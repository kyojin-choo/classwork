<P ALIGN=left>Building well-designed solid waste facilities is one challenge, and operating those facilities is  another. The Lancaster County Solid Waste Management Authority has developed a comprehensive licensing, enforcement and reporting program to ensure the safe and efficient operation of its facilities and to protect the environment.

<P ALIGN=center><STRONG>LICENSING</STRONG>

<P ALIGN=left>The Authority has established a set of rules and regulations that govern the collection and transportation of solid waste and recyclable materials. Each year, the Authority updates these regulations to reflect changes in facility operation, Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection regulations, waste categorization and fee structures.

<P ALIGN=left>According to these rules and regulations, all commercial waste haulers must obtain a license for each one of their vehicles, roll-off containers and trailers. In Lancaster County, approximately 70 companies haul waste from homes, offices, factories and schools. An additional 450 customers are licensed to haul their own waste to Authority facilities. Some 30 companies haul sludge, the  by-product of wastewater treatment, and septage, the waste from septic tanks. Most of the trash haulers also collect recyclable materials and deliver them to separate facilities for processing and sale.

<P ALIGN=left>Those wishing to obtain licenses must show proof of general liability insurance, vehicle insurance and work compensation. They must also agree to abide by the Authority's rules and regulations. Licenses must be displayed on vehicles and containers.

<P ALIGN=left>By licensing waste haulers, the Authority can monitor service and operating standards. For example, if a hauler violates Authority regulations or operates unsafely, the Authority has the right to impose fines or revoke licenses.

<P ALIGN=center><STRONG>COMPLIANCE</STRONG>

<P ALIGN=left>The Authority's rules and regulations also describe what types of waste the Authority will accept at its facilities. Generally speaking, the Authority will dispose of municipal solid waste (the refuse created at homes and businesses, including  construction/demolition debris) and residual waste (created through a  manufacturing process). Most waste generated in Lancaster County falls into these categories. The Authority will not accept hazardous waste, explosives, liquid waste and radioactive materials. County facilities are not suited for these materials which can be problematic or dangerous to landfill or incinerate.

<P ALIGN=left>To ensure that waste haulers do not deliver unacceptable wastes, the Authority stations trained compliance officers at all delivery points to inspect delivery  vehicles and incoming loads.  The compliance officers watch loads of waste as they 
are dumped at the transfer station, resource recovery facility and the Frey Farm Landfill, removing  unacceptable items by hand or, if necessary, with equipment.

<P ALIGN=left>When a violation does occur, unacceptable materials are returned to the waste hauler or are disposed by the Authority at an appropriate facility, and the hauler is given a written warning or a fine. In cases of repeated violations, a waste hauler may lose disposal privileges and licenses. Charges also may be filed in Lancaster County Court.

<P ALIGN=left>In addition to inspecting wastes, compliance officers observe the operation of waste haulers throughout the county to see that all  operating vehicles and containers have permits and that all municipal solid waste generated in the county is delivered to appropriate facilities.

<P ALIGN=center><STRONG>REPORTING</STRONG>

<P ALIGN=left>All waste entering the Authority's transfer  station, resource recovery facility and Frey Farm Landfill is tracked on a special computer program.  Part of this recording system requires that waste haulers complete manifest forms for every load 
of wastes delivered to the Authority.  The manifests ask for information such as:  origin of waste (by municipality); generator of waste (residential, industrial or commercial/institutional); type of material; and waste hauler license number.  The Authority enters this information in the computer system.

<P ALIGN=left>Vehicles are weighed on scales which record, via computer, the weight.  The Authority uses the tonnage and manifest records for computerized customer billing as well as tracking and accumulating data on weights, types and sources of all wastes delivered to Authority facilities. Keeping accurate records enables the Authority to plan and build appropriately sized and efficient solid waste facilities and to develop new waste reduction and recycling programs.
