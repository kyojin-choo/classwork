<HR><A NAME="overview"></A>Chairman Horn and Members of the Subcommittee:
<H3>I. Overview</H3>
My name is Janlori Goldman and I am the Deputy Director of the Center for
Democracy and Technology (CDT). CDT is a non-profit, public interest organization
dedicated to preserving free speech, privacy and other democratic values
on the Internet and other interactive communications media. I appreciate
the opportunity to testify before you today on behalf of CDT in support
of the need for strong, comprehensive federal legislation to protect the
confidentiality of medical records. <BR>
<BR>
One of CDT's primary goals is the passage of federal legislation that establishes
strong, enforceable privacy protection for personally identifiable health
information. We believe that comprehensive legislation that protects the
privacy of health information is critical. The public will not have trust
and confidence in the emerging health information infrastructure if their
sensitive health data is vulnerable to abuse and misuse. We commend the
efforts of Chairman Horn and Representative Gary A. Condit for their leadership
towards enacting legislation to protect the privacy of health information.<BR>
<BR>
Presently, there is no comprehensive federal law that protects peoples'
health records. However, a Louis Harris survey found that most people in
this country mistakenly believe their personal health information is currently
protected by law. And most people mistakenly believe they have a right to
access their own medical information. In fact, only 28 states allow patients
access to their own medical records and only 34 states have confidentiality
laws. Federal privacy policy is urgently needed to address the increasing
demands for health information by those outside the traditional doctor-patient
relationship. Information demands of insurance companies, managed health
care companies, researchers, employers and law enforcement are eroding the
doctor-patient confidentiality that is central to health care. CDT believes
Congress must act to protect the privacy of personally identifiable health
information so that our laws will finally conform, to some extent, with
the American public's perception and expectation that their sensitive medical
records are confidential.<BR>
<BR>
Technological innovations that allow medical records, data and images to
be transferred easily over great distances, impacts our country in significant
ways. The development of a national information infrastructure and information
superhighway are changing the ways that we deal with each other. Traditional
barriers of distance, time and location are disappearing as information
and transactions become computerized -- few relationships in the health
care field will remain unaffected by these changes. In the absence of any
Congressional action, the collection and use of personally identifiable
health information will continue to occur within electronic, networked environments
without privacy protections.<BR>
<BR>
But while this information revolution may hold great promise for enhancing
our nation's health, CDT and others believe that personal health information,
in both paper and electronic form, must be protected by strong, enforceable
privacy rules. Even useful technologies pose potential risks to privacy,
where an individual's need to keep information confidential is forced to
take a back seat in the drive to lower costs, increase efficiency and facilitate
health research through automation. <BR>
<BR>
Last Congress, this Subcommittee held hearings on the Fair Health Information
Practices Act, sponsored by Representative Condit, and co-sponsored by Chairman
Horn, Representative Craig Thomas, and others. The bill, H.R. 435, was approved
by the full Government Operations Committee as part of its ongoing consideration
of health care reform.<SUP><A HREF="#foot_1">1</A></SUP> Testifying in support
of H.R. 435 last Congress were industry representatives, privacy and consumer
advocates and health policy specialists, including: Rep. Nydia Velazquez
(D-NY); Nan Hunter, Department of Health and Human Services; Dr. Alan Westin,
Columbia University; John Baker, Equifax, Inc.; Dr. Donald Lewers, American
Medical Association; Fredric Entin, American Hospital Association; Joel
E. Gimpel, Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, representing the Workgroup
on Electronic Data Interchange; Kathleen Frawley, American Health Information
Management Association; Dr. Richard Barker, IBM Corporation; Dr. Martin
Sepulveda, IBM Corporation; Robert S. Bolan, Medic Alert Foundation International;
and Professor Paul Schwartz, University of Arkansas Law School. In January,
1995, Representative Condit reintroduced H.R. 435. Representative Jim McDermott
(D-WA) recently introduced H.R. 3482, also aimed at protecting personal
health information. Our testimony today outlines the need and demand for
federal privacy protection, and key principles that should be embodied in
any comprehensive legislation protecting health privacy.<A NAME="need"></A>
<P><CENTER><HR WIDTH="50%"></CENTER>
<H3><A NAME="consensus"></A>II. The Need and Demand for Federal Privacy
Protection</H3>
<STRONG>A. Consensus Exists</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
A consensus exists that federal legislation is needed to protect the privacy
of personal health care records. In 1993, a conference in Washington, D.C.
was co-sponsored by the U.S. Office of Consumer Affairs, the American Health
Information Management Association, and Equifax. Panelists from the American
Medical Association, CIGNA Health Care, the U.S. Public Interest Research
Group, Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility and IBM urged policymakers
to address the issue of health information privacy.<BR>
<BR>
At the conference, Louis Harris and Associations released their Health Information
Privacy Survey, prepared with the assistance of Dr. Alan Westin, a privacy
expert at Columbia University. The survey found that the majority of the
public (56%) favored the enactment of strong comprehensive federal legislation
governing the privacy of health care information. In fact, eighty-five percent
(85%) said that protecting the confidentiality of medical records was absolutely
essential or very important to them. Most people wanted penalties imposed
for unauthorized disclosure of medical records (96%), guaranteed access
to their own health records (96%) and rules regulating third-party access.
<BR>
<BR>
Buttressing these findings, another 1992 Harris survey revealed that nearly
ninety percent (90%) of the public believed computers make it easier for
someone to improperly obtain confidential personal information. Twenty-five
percent (25%) of the public believed they had been a victim of an improper
disclosure of personal medical information.<BR>
<BR>
A number of studies have determined that a federal law is needed to protect
peoples' medical records. Georgetown University Law Professor Larry Gostin
concluded that a federal preemptive statute based on fair information practices
was necessary to protect personal privacy as networked health information
databases continued to grow.<SUP><A HREF="#foot_2">2</A></SUP> In 1994,
the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) issued a report entitled Protecting
Privacy in Computerized Medical Information, which addressed the consequences
of computerizing medical records on individual privacy. In recommending
comprehensive federal legislation, OTA found that:<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>[t]he expanded use of medical records for non-treatment purposes
exacerbates the shortcomings of existing legal schemes to protect privacy
in patient information. The law must address the increase in the flow of
data outward from the medical care relationship by both addressing the questions
of appropriate access to data and providing redress to those who have been
wronged by privacy violations. Lack of such guidelines, and failure to make
them enforceable, could affect the quality and integrity of the medical
record itself.<SUP><A HREF="#foot_3">3</A> </SUP></BLOCKQUOTE>
The Institute of Medicine (IOM) of the National Academy of Science released
a study that focused on the risks and opportunities associated with protecting
the privacy and confidentiality of personally identifiably health data.
The IOM report recommended that Congress enact legislation to preempt state
laws to establish a uniform requirement for the confidentiality and protection
of privacy rights for personally identifiable health data. It also suggested
that Congress create a Code of Fair Health Information Practices to ensure
the proper balance between required disclosures, use of data, and patient
privacy.<BR>
<BR>
Currently, the National Research Council (NRC) is preparing a report on
health care organizational applications of privacy and security by analyzing
the distribution and flow of health care information among patients, providers,
and third-party institutions. The NRC plans to issue its report on organizational
practices that support the security and confidentiality of electronic health
care information by the end of 1996. <BR>

<P><CENTER><HR WIDTH="50%"></CENTER>
<P><STRONG>B. Misuse of Personal Health Information </STRONG><BR>
<BR>
The unauthorized disclosure of personal health information can have disastrous
consequences (see attached news stories and editorials). New York Congresswoman
Nydia Velazquez won her House seat only after overcoming the results of
an unauthorized disclosure. Her confidential medical records -- including
details of a bout with depression and a suicide attempt -- were faxed to
a New York newspaper and television stations during her campaign. In another
instance, a journalist disguised himself as a doctor, obtained the medical
record of an actress, and published that she had been treated for a sexually
transmitted disease.<BR>
<BR>
More common, and in some ways more troubling than the well-publicized privacy
invasions of public figures, are the consequences suffered by ordinary individuals
whose privacy has been compromised by the disclosure of medical information.
For instance, federal auditors demanded the names of patients seeking confidential
AIDS treatment at a Boston clinic. Once the auditors obtained the names,
they disclosed the information to other agencies.<SUP><A HREF="#foot_4">4</A></SUP>
The Harvard Community Health Plan, a Boston H.M.O., admitted to routinely
entering detailed notes of psychotherapy sessions into its computer records,
which were then accessible by all clinical employees.<SUP><A HREF="#foot_5">5</A></SUP>
In Maryland, eight Medicaid clerks were prosecuted for selling computerized
record printouts of recipients' financial resources and dependents to sales
representatives of managed care companies.<SUP><A HREF="#foot_6">6</A></SUP>
Even more common are the practices of some H.M.Os of sending letters to
employers detailing the health problems of their employees. Surprised individuals
have also discovered that personal problems they discussed with employee
assistance program counselors became common knowledge among their co-workers.<SUP><A HREF="#foot_7">7</A></SUP>
There are a number of other well-documented instances of breaches of health
privacy.<SUP><A HREF="#foot_8">8</A></SUP> Undoubtedly, there are millions
of similar breaches that occur either without the knowledge of the individuals
harmed or outside of the media's spotlight.<BR>
<BR>
The need for comprehensive federal legislation becomes more imperative as
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit recently ruled that an employer's
right to access their employee's health records outweighed the employee's
right to privacy in their health information. In Doe v. Southeastern Pennsylvania
Transportation Authority,<SUP><A HREF="#foot_9">9</A></SUP> the court overturned
a $125,000 jury's award to an employee who was taking the antiviral drug
AZT and whose infection with HIV became known to co-workers due to a breach
in confidentiality of the employer's prescription drug benefits plan. While
the Court agreed that employees have a constitutional privacy right in their
prescription drug plan records, it found the right was limited by their
employer's interest in monitoring such plans to determine fraud, drug abuse
and excessive costs. The majority's decision rested on the fact that this
employee suffered no adverse employment action, such as harassment or demotion,
as a result of the unauthorized disclosure. Dissenting in the decision,
Judge Lewis stated, &quot;I hope I am wrong, but I predict that the court's
decision in this case will make it easier in the future for employers to
disclose their employees' private medical information, obtained during an
audit of the company's health benefit plan, and to escape constitutional
liability for harassment or other harms suffered by their employees as a
result of that disclosure.&quot;<SUP><A HREF="#foot_10">10</A></SUP> <BR>
<BR>
Errors found in medical records have also been difficult to correct and
control. For instance, Mary Rose Taylor of Springfield, Massachusetts was
denied health insurance for over a year because of a computer error at the
Medical Information Bureau (MIB), a database of medical information used
by insurance companies. MIB reported that Ms. Taylor had an abnormal urinalysis,
even though she had only taken a blood test. Ms. Taylor was forced to go
to the insurance commissioner of her state to correct the error -- and it
was only then that she finally received health insurance.<A NAME="consequences"></A><BR>
<P><CENTER><HR WIDTH="50%"></CENTER>
<P><STRONG>C. Consequences of Not Protecting Personal Health Information</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
Despite the public and private horror stories about breaches of privacy,
many Americans trust that the information they share with their doctor is
kept confidential. Indeed, the traditional doctor-patient relationship is
intended to foster trust and to encourage full disclosure. However, once
a patient's information is submitted to a third-party payor, or to any other
entity, the ethical -- and sometimes legal -- relationship between doctor
and patient evaporates, putting patient privacy at risk. In fact, in a Harris
survey, 93% of those termed &quot;leaders&quot;, including hospital CEOs,
health insurance CEOs, physicians, nurses and state regulators, believe
that third party payors need to be governed by detailed confidentiality
and privacy policies.<BR>
<BR>
Within our current health care system, many individuals engage in tactics
to avoid potential threats to their privacy. Some people routinely ask doctors
to record a false diagnosis because they fear their employer may see their
health records. Some people withhold information from doctors, for fear
of losing control over sensitive information. In psychiatric practices,
it is common for patients to ask doctors not to take notes during sessions,
fearing the danger that such records, if in the wrong hands, could ruin
a job opportunity, harm their reputation, or prevent them from changing
insurance companies. Numerous people take the simple -- if costly -- step
of paying for medical services out-of-pocket to avoid the creation of insurance
records, even though they are entitled to, and have paid for, insurance
coverage.<BR>
<BR>
A few insurers have been candid enough to concede that their primary business
relationship is with the employer and not the employee/patient. These insurers
may be reluctant to disclose individually-identifiable health information
if requested by an employer, but they will comply if pressed. Most patients,
of course, believe the fiduciary relationship is between themselves and
their doctors, and don't realize that a third party with no direct relationship
to their medical treatment actually controls the information. It is intolerable
to support a system in which an employer's payment of a portion of employees'
health care premiums, amounts to employers' unfettered access to employee's
health records.<BR>
<BR>
Advances in technology exacerbate the lack of uniform, federal privacy protection
for identifiable health information. For example, at the state and local
levels, employers, insurers, and health care providers are forming coalitions
to develop automated and linked health care systems containing lifetime
health histories on millions of Americans. The primary goals of these projects
are cost reduction and improved quality of care. State coalitions are attempting
to address the privacy, confidentiality, and security of health data by
crafting internal guidelines, regulations, and contracts. In addition, in
those states where the automation of health care information is seen as
a key component of a state's health care reform package, state legislatures
and public agencies are attempting to enact legislation that establishes
a right of privacy in protected health information. These states are also
attempting to design effective enforcement penalties and oversight mechanisms
to monitor the information practices of these newly created health data
systems.<BR>
<BR>
While some attempts are being made to address privacy concerns, the lack
of a comprehensive policy protecting individual's privacy across all health
care settings will leave individual privacy vulnerable. The outcome of this
piecemeal, state-by-state approach to protecting the privacy and security
of health care information will lead to conflict among the states and ultimately
set back the overall goal of privacy protection. Relegating the protection
of health care information to the states' different guidelines, policies
and laws leaves individuals subject to differing degrees of privacy depending
on where they receive their health care. In some instances, this means that
individuals traveling across county or state lines to receive necessary
medical treatment may lose their ability to control how their personal medical
information is used. Moreover, states and local governments with different
rules governing the use of health care information may be prevented from
sharing health care information contained in their systems with neighboring
states that insufficiently protect privacy.<BR>
<BR>
Health care records, in both paper and electronic form, deserve privacy
protection. But the vulnerability of information to unauthorized access
and use grows exponentially as the computer makes possible the instant sharing
of information. As a 1992 study by the Workgroup for Electronic Data Interchange
(WEDI) pointed out: &quot;The paper medium is cumbersome and expensive...Ironically,
it is the negative impact of the paper medium...that has minimized the risk
of breaches of confidentiality. Although a breach could occur, if someone
gave access to health records or insurance claim forms, the magnitude of
the breach was limited by the sheer difficulty of unobtrusively reviewing
large numbers of records or claim forms.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Nevertheless, technology itself is not the evil. Information systems can
actually be designed to promote the confidentiality and security of personal
information. For instance, a well-designed computerized system can more
closely guard individual privacy, than paper filing systems. The key is
to recognize technology's potential to enhance privacy, not simply to focus
on the risks technology poses to undermine privacy. There is widespread
agreement among privacy and security experts that protections must be build
in on the front-end; it is too difficult and risky to enact them only after
a major privacy breach. Privacy and security must regain their own place
as cornerstones of the medical relationship. Only then can we achieve the
potential for enhancing privacy and security.<A NAME="principles"></A><BR>
<P><CENTER><HR WIDTH="75%"></CENTER>
<H3>III. Principles for a Health Privacy Policy</H3>
CDT believes that the following principles for protecting personal health
information must be incorporated in any health privacy bill:
<UL>
<LI>Individuals must have the right to see, copy, and amend their own medical
records;
<LI>Individuals must control the disclosure and use of their personal health
information -- rules must be established requiring doctors, insurance companies,
and other &quot;health information trustees&quot; to obtain individual consent
prior to the use and disclosure of personal health information;
<LI>Safeguards must be developed for the use and disclosure of personal
health information;
<LI>All those who are given access to personal health information must be
bound by comprehensive rules that ensure the protection of such information;
<LI>A warrant requirement for law enforcement access to peoples' health
records must be created; and
<LI>Strict civil penalties and criminal sanctions must be imposed for violations
of the legislation, and individuals must be given a private right of action
against those who mishandle their personal medical information.
</UL>
Without comprehensive protections such as these, the widespread electronic
transmission of records in a framework of piecemeal and incomplete protections,
will produce the worst of both worlds -- confusion and red tape for legitimate
data users, and debilitating fear and mistrust for people seeking medical
care.<A NAME="conclusion"></A><BR>
<P><CENTER><HR WIDTH="50%"></CENTER>
<H3>IV. Conclusion</H3>
<BR>
CDT believes that the protection of personally identifiable health information
is critical to ensuring public trust and confidence in the emerging health
information infrastructure. Health care reform cannot move forward without
assuring the American public that the highly sensitive personal information
contained in their medical records will be protected from abuse and misuse.
As the Harris surveys indicate, people are highly suspicious of large scale
computerization and believe that their health records are in dire need of
privacy protection. If people are expected to embrace and participate in
this rapidly changing health environment, the price of their participation
must not be the loss of control of sensitive personal information.<BR>
<BR>
Any system that fails to win the public's trust will fail to win the public's
support. We risk having individuals withdraw from the full and honest participation
in their own health care because they fear losing their privacy. Congress
should not allow people to fall through the cracks of the health care system
because the privacy of their health information is unprotected. We urge
you to move forward with legislation that adequately protects health information
privacy.<A NAME="footnotes"></A><BR>
