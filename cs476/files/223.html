<H2>I. Introduction and Overview: Guiding Principles From The
Internet Experience</H2>

<P>
We commend the Commission for holding this forum to explore means
of providing affordable, widely available access to the NII in
general, and the Internet in particular. The growth of the Internet
gives the Federal Communications Commission a unique opportunity
to advance one of its core communications policy goals: providing
Americans with ready access to a diversity of information sources
and communication opportunities. In these brief remarks, CDT hopes
to offer observations on critical factors which have lead to the
dramatic growth of the Internet, unique characteristics which
make the Internet a rich forum for democratic discourse, and lessons
for the future that we can take from these developments. 
<P>
The Internet has shown that both choice of architecture and cost
of service are essential to providing widespread access to a diversity
of information. The Internet manifests five critical attributes
in its basic architecture that give it such potential to enhance
democratic discourse:
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="#II_1">Decentralized, gatekeeper-free access</A>;
<LI><A HREF="#II_2">Bi-directional, interactive capability</A>;
<LI><A HREF="#II_3">Multiple, competitive access points</A>;
<LI><A HREF="#II_4">Open standards</A>;
<LI><A HREF="#II_5">Affordable service</A>.<BR>

</UL>

<P>
In considering policies to promote broader access to advanced
communications infrastructure, we hope that the Commission will
take these characteristics as baseline policy goals. The democratic
potential of the Internet will only be realized with broad access
to the Net for both individuals and community organizations. The
Commission can help bring that potential of the Internet to the
broad cross-section of the population by encouraging the development
of new access options that promote these essential attributes
of the Internet architecture.<BR>

<H2>II. Open, Decentralized Architecture</H2>

<P>
The strength of the Internet derives from both affordable access
and a uniquely open architecture. Traditional communications media
such as radio and television have been affordable and readily
available around the country, but have failed to enable full democratic
because of architectural limitations. For example, online discussions
of political issues enable users to exchange views, and even pose
questions to political figures, in a way that broadcast television
can never support. The Internet's architecture allows for a diversity
of views and exchange of information which are simply impossible
in any other communications medium. 
<H3><A NAME="II_1">1. Decentralized, Gatekeeper-free Infrastructure</A>
</H3>

<P>
The Internet supports such a great diversity of opinion, ideas,
and information because it is a <I>decentralized</I> network.
A user can create a new web site or participate in a Usenet newsgroup
without obtaining permission in advance from any central authority.
For example, to create a Web page that will be publicly accessible
to millions of Internet users around the world, one need only
find a Internet-connected computer and, often, pay that operator
of that computer for web site hosting service. The decentralized
architecture of the Internet has guaranteed that there will be
numerous web site hosts from which to chose. Unlike traditional
broadcast media, the Internet has no central control point. Anyone
with content to publish or ideas to exchange can do so from any
point on the network.
<P>
Equally important, the resources needed to establish a new web
page or post a new idea are essentially unlimited. Adding a new
web page or a new newsgroup posting does not require that another
site or page be eliminated from the Net. In fact, the marginal
cost of the last web page added to the net is equal to or less
than the cost of the first page. This is an environment characterized
by an <I>abundance</I> of communications opportunities.
<P>
This abundance stands in sharp contrast to the scarcity of channels
and spectrum which has been such a prominent feature, for example,
of the broadcast and cable television media. Broadcasting a program
on today's television systems requires that one compete for, and
usually pay a high price for, a channel slot under the control
of the broadcaster or cable operator. The high demand for channels
in traditional media has raised their cost far beyond the means
of most community organizations and all but the wealthiest individuals.
As new infrastructure access options develop it is critical that
they continue to support access in this decentralized manner.
<H3><A NAME="II_2">2. Bi-directional, Interactive Capability</A>
</H3>

<P>
All Internet users are able to be both speakers and listeners,
publishers and readers, content providers and content consumers.
The bi-directional, interactive nature of the Net is another key
attribute that makes it such a unique and effective forum for
democratic discourse. Indeed, only on the proverbial town square
is there a greater degree of interactive, back-and-forth communications
than what is possible online. As advanced telecommunications access
services develop, it will be essential to assure continued, up-stream
and down-stream, interactive communications paths.
<H3><A NAME="II_3">3. Multiple, Competitive Access Points</A>
</H3>

<P>
From the beginning, the Internet was designed to support multiple
access points. Initially, this was to meet military planners need
for a disaster-proof network. Today, we all reap the benefit of
this decentralized architecture that allows more service providers
to connect to the Net every day and make new services available.
In most areas of the country, Internet access is available from
a variety of sources, including small and large Internet service
providers, commercial online services, schools and libraries,
freenets and other community networks, as well as traditional
bulletin board systems (BBSs) linked to the Internet. 
<P>
The growth, technical advances, and increasingly wide reach of
the Internet has been spurred in recent years by the vibrant,
competitive market for Internet access services. Citizens and
organizations that rely on the Internet have been the beneficiaries
of this competitive environment. Service providers compete to
offer better prices, more reliable basic access, and innovative
new services such as web site hosting with the latest web server
features.
<P>
The benefits of an open access network go beyond mere price competition.
Open interconnection features of the Internet assure that services
will develop to meet the varying needs of the diverse Internet
user community, from large corporations to small libraries, individuals,
and small community organizations. A great diversity of users
is made possible because a variety of service providers are able
to co-exist on the Internet. This breadth of users creates the
potential for a true diversity of opinion and ideas in online
forums.
<H3><A NAME="II_4">4. Open Standards</A></H3>

<P>
An open standards environment allows the Internet to evolve innovative
new services to meet changing user needs. From year to year, the
face of the Internet changes. Today, many people think of and
experience the Internet as primarily the World Wide Web. Yet,
two or three years ago, the Web was little more than an experimental
service being developed in a physics laboratory in Switzerland.
This year's World Wide Web is vastly different, and more powerful,
flexible, and easy to use than it was last year. At a more technical
level, Internet routing and addressing protocols are evolving
in order to meeting increasing usage levels around the world.
<P>
These and other technical advances have been possible because
of the open, public standards on which the Internet is built.
In this open environment, new technologies can be developed and
deployed by various members of the Internet community. New standards
which gain popularity are adopted by the Net as a whole, while
others are not. This development process, however, can proceed
relatively easily because the basic Internet standards are public
and available as building blocks for new developments. 
<H3><A NAME="II_5">5. Affordable Access</A></H3>

<P>
The Internet's architecture is what makes it unique, but it would
be of no use if access were too expensive for users. There are
good reasons to believe that information on the Internet will
be inherently more affordable than other media. However, as multimedia
and other high-bandwidth applications become more popular the
ability of the voice-call oriented telecommunications infrastructure
to maintain affordable access to the Net will be called into question.
<P>
Three separate cost elements ought to be distinguished in this
discussion: 1) the cost of a personal computer or other access
hardware; 2) the cost of Internet or online services; and 3) the
cost of the underlying telecommunications service which connects
the user to the Internet or online service. Hardware costs remain
substantial, but new developments in the market such as WebTV,
network computers, and consumer-oriented PCs suggest that this
barrier may be easing. Internet access service costs continue
to decrease in the face of a competitive market. Finally, although
the low cost of basic telephone service (especially flat rate
local calling) has been viewed as a significant boon to the Net,
most Internet users around the country have no viable option other
than slow, analog phone lines. Internet users need more choices
-- particularly architectural choices -- in the market for the
basic telecommunications components of Internet access in order
to maintain affordable, higher-bandwidth methods of access to
the network.
<P>
The question of affordable access is raised most directly in the
Commission's ongoing proceedings on Internet access fees. CDT
will be filing comments in those proceedings and will seek to
address these issues more fully at that time. <BR>

<H2>III. Conclusion: Toward a More Affordable, Higher Capacity,
Digital, Decentralized Network Infrastructure</H2>

<P>
Again, we commend the Commission for beginning this inquiry into
the question of how to promote the availability of higher bandwidth
services. The challenge facing the Commission and other policy
makers going forward is to enable users to have access to increasingly
high capacity, affordable digital access options in a manner that
is consistent with the fundamental architectural characteristics
that have made the Internet such an important new medium. High
bandwidth service is needed, but is only useful where it maintains
the open, decentralized, competitive environment that has helped
the Internet grow to serve democratic values.
<P>
Achieving all these goals, in the context of other changes occurring
throughout the telecommunications market, will indeed be a challenge.
CDT does not come to this forum with a fixed policy prescription,
but rather a hope that the Commission's activities can be guided
by the stunning success already manifest in the development of
the Internet. When sitting to consider the application of First
Amendment principles to the Internet, a federal court in Philadelphia
found that the Internet is &quot;the most participatory form of
mass speech yet developed....&quot; The extraordinary success
of the Internet thus far, and the great potential that it holds
out, should serve as a model for the Commission in advancing its
basic communications policy objectives.
