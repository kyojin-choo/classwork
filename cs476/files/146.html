<P>This is the first of a regular biannual series of Newsletters for LEFM
users.  Its aim is to keep users abreast of current issues, providing support
for their work and updating them on developments in the LEFM software.  The
editors would be pleased to receive comments on this first issue and suggestions
for subsequent issues (write or Email the Editors of the Newsletter, Saxon
Brettell and Rob Wilson at the addresses below).   The Newsletter is published
in both electronic and paper versions.</P>
<H2>Version 2.1 of LEFM Released</H2>
<P>Version 2.1 of <I>Local Economy Forecasting Model</I> has been released,
and all users updating to the March round of CE/IER forecasts are receiving this
new version as standard.  The latest version incorporates additional features,
reflecting suggestions from LEFM users, that are designed to make the model more
versatile.  Version 2.1 includes flexible tabulations and further options
regarding occupation assumptions.  In addition to the locally based assumptions
that already existed in LEFM, the user can now impose national or regional
trends in occupation change upon their local areas.</P>
<H2>Have you been SIC92'ed?</H2>
<P>LEFM updates from March will also include data from the 1993 Census of
Employment, the first data set at a local level released on the basis of the
SIC92 classification.  This is a major reclassification from SIC80.  Some
problems were initially evident in the data released by NOMIS with some
inconsistencies in the areas and these data were withdrawn and re-released. 
Also the 1991 dual-classified data essential for understanding the effect of the
changes at local level have only just been released, and very interesting they
are too....
</P>
<P>Users of these data will know that the SIC92 revision has required a major
reclassification of employment by the Office of National Statistics (ONS has
been formed from the merger of OPCS and CSO), with overnight some 10% of UK
manufacturing employment being reclassified into business services.  Local
analysts will need to look carefully at the changes in their own local data sets
and in principle this is best done with the 1991 data since it is dual coded,
although 1993 is a fuller data set.  Census of Employment time series are the
major guide to economic restructuring at the local level so that this break in
the series will be a major concern to local practitioners.  The good news is
that in future these data will be available annually from ONS, with less than a
year's delay (although based on a sample rather than a full census).  CE/IER
have assessed the dual-classified information just released for 1991 and have
established a linkage procedure for constructing consistent series for 1981-93. 
Local authorities will have the advantage of access to detailed information on
the reclassification of their local firms and we are happy to work with local
agencies with LEFM if they want to undertake a more thorough analysis of their
local data sets so as to establish an agreed consistent data series at their
local level - more on these items and other data changes at the....</P>
<H2>LEFM Annual Conference 6/7 June</H2>
<P>This conference is now an established annual event for LEFM users.  We
intend it to be the major opportunity for LEFM users with different experiences
to meet, exchange information and discuss practical issues with other users and
CE/IER providers - so put the date in your diaries now!  Further details on the
conference and a booking form are enclosed with the hard copy version of this
newsletter.  For additional information and to book your place, contact Barbara
Wilson at IER.</P>
<P>As the number of LEFM users is rapidly expanding across the UK, this is set
to become a major conference for local economy practitioners and we wish to
reflect this in the content of the conference.  As last year, it will be a
two-day event held on <B>Thursday June 6-Friday June 7 1996</B>. It takes
place, also as last year, in the Scarman House conference centre located in the
grounds of the University of Warwick.  This gives state-of-the-art facilities
for conferencing, excellent guest accommodation and catering, all in a splendid
environmental setting - just the forum for a series of stimulating presentations
this year.</P>
<P>In addition to contributions from CE and IER, there will be a number of
external speakers at this year's event.  To complement the formal sessions on
important new LEFM developments and advice on how to get the most out of new
data available at local level, a broad theme for this year will be to cover the
issues of partnership building, and developing local economic strategies.  This
reflects our awareness that many users are seeing the role of their
organisations both deepen and broaden.  As a consequence, they are frequently
being asked to provide economic context and support for locally-based
initiatives involving partnerships (often in groups involving local authorities,
TEC/LECs, Chambers, Government Offices and Business Links).  Such partnership
building has been important in attracting inward investment.  Users also face
increasing calls for evaluation of their own agency's work and its impact on
local economic activity.  LEFM can provide a suitable framework for such an
evaluation.  The speakers will review the issues involved, and draw lessons from
a number of recent projects involving impact analysis and policy evaluation for
local partners.</P>
<P>There will also be plenty of formal and informal opportunities to talk to
speakers, designers and other LEFM users, and to gain or improve hands-on
experience using the LEFM software.  There will be LEFM practical sessions for
novices and for more experienced practitioners, and opportunities to receive
one-to-one based advice from our expert team. Indeed there will be time to
interrogate software designers, if necessary continuing late into the night in
the conference bar!  Between sessions and in the morning and evening, as our
participants discovered last year, one can also take advantage of the
University's splendid facilities for sport, with extensive walks available in
the beautiful environment of the grounds, especially useful for laptop users.</P>
<H2>Developments of Enhanced LEFM Software</H2>
<P><B>EVALEFM</B> - a local-economy-forecasting-impact-evaluation model, with
enhanced facilities for evaluating the impact of European investment spending,
has been developed and implemented for Merseyside and Strathclyde local areas
</P>
<P><B>EULEFM </B>- a local economy forecasting model for Europe is under
development.  A German language version of LEFM has been developed for use in
the new L&auml;nder of Germany in cooperation with Ecometrika GMbH in Berlin. 
This is designed to work with the E3ME model developed by a team led by
Cambridge Econometrics for Europe in the same way that LEFM works with CE's MDM
national-regional model in the UK.  The E3ME model was developed under the
European Commission's Joule II R&amp;D programme, and distinguishes some 32
industry sectors.  The E3ME project began in 1993 with the aim of developing a
single regionalised model of Europe designed to evaluate policies to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions by some 60% over the next 50 years.  A proposal to
enhance the model and extend it to cover new Member States has been accepted
under the Joule III Programme, and this will form the starting point for the
next phase of research.</P>
<H2>Recent Applications</H2>
<P>Among significant recent model developments for LEFM has been work enhancing
the simulation facilities in LEFM.  This has been used to evaluate the impact of
EU and UK government support for local areas.  Work for the Brent Regeneration
Agency, the Stockport Partnership, and the regional partners in Merseyside and
Strathclyde region, has led to enhanced treatment of the supply-side of the
model.</P>
<H3>Merseyside Economic Assessment</H3>
<P>Merseyside has been granted EU Structural Funds status under the Objective 1
category. The Monitoring Committee of the regional partners has overall
responsibility for monitoring the implementation of the agreed Single
Programming Document (SPD) for Merseyside, designed to facilitate convergence of
Merseyside towards average European income levels over 1994-99.  Work on the SPD
was originally undertaken in 1994 by CE and IER.  They used version 1.01 LEFM
software model to help set quantitative `baseline' targets for EU support on
infrastructure and human resources.  These targets were subsequently embodied in
`Merseyside 2000', the EU-approved SPD providing the basis for implementation of
the detailed programme.  This work was followed up in 1995 with a second project
giving an interim assessment of the programme after two years and reviewing the
guidance on approvals.  This follow-up work was undertaken for the Labour Market
Strategy Group (representing Merseyside Government Office, local TECs, local
authorities and others) in close association with KPMG's Liverpool office.  It
used an enhanced version 2.01 EVALEFM model to provide an up-to-date
counterfactual scenario, (ie an assessment of what the local economy might have
achieved if the Objective 1 programme had not occurred) and compared this with a
baseline forecast simulation.  A number of variant future development scenarios
were simulated reflecting enhanced support for `clusters' of export-oriented
sectors in the local area.  The EVALEFM model was thereby used to underpin
effective labour market policy advice.  The work informed the dissemination of
guidance for applicants for funds in 1996, and supported the information
requirements of local economic development agencies.  The outcome - Merseyside
Economic Assessment - established a consensus approach for the many
participating agencies, allowing them to support the recommended new initiatives
to achieve the programme objectives.  LEFM was seen by the partners as a
fundamental tool for achieving a consensus among the partner organisations,
since it provided a clear framework for considering the development
alternatives.</P>
<H3>East Midlands Economic Review</H3>
<P>Version 2.0 multi-area LEFM software provided the framework for an economic
assessment of the East Midlands economy for a research group comprising the
Government Office for the East Midlands and the seven independent agencies (TECs
and recently merged TECs and Chambers) concerned with local training, enterprise
and development.  The study, undertaken by CE and York Consulting, established
an overall economic appraisal for the region and the seven local TEC areas in
close consultation with the East Midlands research group.  The work was guided
by a forward-looking study utilising a LEFM for each of the seven areas,
consistent with the latest CE forecast for the East Midlands region.  The study
identified the sources of economic growth and restructuring effects at a
detailed industry level, identifying strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and
threats to the component local economies of the region in a context of the
global competition faced by the UK economy. The outcome was a comprehensive
report suitable as a reference document for the agencies and for use in Single
Regeneration Budget (SRB) and other forms of funding bids, and the provision of
TEC-level LEFM software embodying the detailed forecasts from the study.</P>
<H3>Toyota Impact</H3>
<P>Analysis of historical behaviour and trends is not always a good guide to
future events. Major discontinuities can arise as a result of closures of large
organisation or substantial inward investment. The LEFM package is designed to
allow users to address such issues explicitly using an impact module.</P>
<P>This has been used to assess the impact of both Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the
Toyota investment in Burnaston in Derbyshire. The former is a retrospective
analysis of what the effects of Phase 1 have been, while the analysis of Phase 2
is prospective. In both cases the LEFM software enables an analysis of both
direct and indirect effects of the investment on the local economy.</P>
<P>The results illustrate the substantial effect that the Toyota investment has
had on the local area. In total, some 6,000 jobs will have probably been created
in the south Derbyshire area by the end of Phase 2, of which about a third are
indirect. The package also enables an assessment of the sensitivity of these
conclusions to a range of alternative assumptions. Further details on how to use
the impact module of LEFM are available on request.</P>
<H3>Partnerships between TECs and Local Authorities</H3>
<P>Partnerships between TECs, Councils and other bodies are very much the
vogue.  Some have been going strong for a number of years.  A good case in point
is the partnership between Leicestershire Training and Enterprise Council and
Leicestershire County Council. They have been working together in producing a
Labour Market Assessment for Leicestershire for the last four years.</P>
<P>Their most recent publication <B>Leicestershire Economic Assessment, March
1996</B> published jointly by the TEC and Council, is based on the use of LEFM. 
LEFM has provided a framework which the partners have used to work together and
develop their own view of local economic and labour market prospects.  This has
included linking the LEFM results with detailed demographic modelling and
forecasting work undertaken by the Council including numerous sector studies.</P>
<P>Details of these publications are available from Leicestershire TEC.  Call
0116 265 1515 for further information.</P>
<H3>Educational Reforms and Reorganisation: Use of LEFM in Careers Advice</H3>
<P>The dramatic changes under way in the further and higher educational system
and related organisations have highlighted the need for information about
employment and careers prospects.  Educational establishments are now charged
with ensuring that their courses have relevance to the local and national
economies.</P>
<P>The reorganisation of the way in which careers advice is delivered has also
focused the attention of some careers advisors on how they can make the best use
of the available information to provide the most useful advice to their clients.
 Sussex Careers Services Ltd (previously East Sussex Careers Service) is at the
forefront of such developments and has found LEFM a useful item in its tool-kit.</P>
<P>The present version of LEFM does not analyse qualifications held by the
workforce explicitly. However, CE/IER are currently considering whether such an
addition to the package would be a valuable enhancement.  Readers' thoughts on
this issue are welcomed.  Please contact Saxon Brettell or Rob Wilson on the
phone numbers or Email addresses given at the end of this newsletter.</P>
<H2>Description of the Local Economy Forecasting Model</H2>
<P>LEFM is a general economic forecasting model for local areas capable of
addressing issues that link development and policy.  The essential purpose of
the model is to provide a forward- looking framework to inform analysts and
decision-makers at the local level about the key economic features of their
locality, including the main behavioural and technical links between the economy
and the labour market.</P>
