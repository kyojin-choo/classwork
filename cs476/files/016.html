<FONT SIZE="+2">O</FONT>n Saturday, January 18, 1992, an article about Peggy Maley, a PacifiCare member and victim of breast cancer, appeared in the Chino Daily Bulletin.  Peggy had been told that PacifiCare would not pay for a bone marrow transplant to treat her condition, since this procedure is regarded as experimental for breast cancer and is therefore not covered by the plan.
<p>
A few days later, the local television station, KTTV, picked up the story.  Then PacifiCare got a call from Sam Donaldson, who was planning to interview Peggy Maley as part of a report on health insurance for "Prime Time Live," a national network show.
<p>
At 10:00 p.m. on January 29, 1992, the vice president for corporate communications for PacifiCare Health Systems called her Nelson Communications Group account manager at home.  By noon the following day, she had received a detailed document giving her a step-by-step approach to dealing with this crisis.
<p>
<h3>Goals.</h3>
Prepare Pacificare spokespersons for interview with Sam Donaldson, build a case which supported the organization's approach to the Maley case.
<p>
<h3>Tactics.</h3>
Nelson Communications offered counsel based on five strategies: (1) gather the facts; (2) hold a crisis team meeting and develop an official statement and question and answer document;  (3) identify spokespeople and  media-train them; (4) determine which audiences to alert to the possibility of the show airing; and (5) determine follow-up if the segment airs.
<p>
The chief executive officer, chief operating officer and medical director of PacifiCare Health Systems were media-trained and briefed on the Q & A document.  When Sam Donaldson interviewed them, they were ready for his questions.
<p>
<h3>Results.</h3>
The extensive preparation clearly paid off.  Sam Donaldson did not air PacifiCare's interview.
<p>
Clearly, the reasoned answers of the PacifiCare senior team were not suitable for the show.  Instead, two other insurance companies were featured.
<p>
PacifiCare also settled with Peggy Maley, and she received the transplant despite its experimental nature.
<p>
Nelson Communications advised follow-up action so that a similar situation did not occur again; for example, that a form letter not be used in advising a patient with a life-threatening disease that a certain type of treatment has been denied.
<p>
Alan Hoops, COO, told the vice president of corporate communications that the Q&A documents were  an excellent and extremely useful tool for the company in a time of crisis.
