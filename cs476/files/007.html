<a name="RTFToC21">INTRODUCTION</a><p>
<p>
The cryosphere is a major component of the hydrosphere and interacts
significantly with the global climate system, the geosphere, and the 
biosphere.
Over 30 percent of the Earth's land surface is covered seasonally by snow, and
about 10 percent is covered permanently with snow or ice.<p>
<p>
Snow and ice play important interactive roles in regional climates, because
snow has a higher albedo than any other natural surface. The earliest signs of
global climate change are likely in the polar regions and in the seasonal snow
cover and alpine glaciers. For investigations in hydrology and land-surface
climatology, seasonal snow cover and alpine glaciers are critical to the
radiation and water balances. Over major portions of the middle and high
latitudes, and at high elevations in the tropical latitudes, snow and alpine
glaciers are the largest contributors to runoff in rivers and to ground-water
recharge. The dual problems of estimating both the quantity of water held by
seasonal snow packs and timing of snowmelt confront snow hydrologists.
Understanding the processes in the seasonal snow cover is also important for
studies of the chemical balance of alpine drainage basins, because of
translocation of anions and cations within the snow pack and possible
concentrated release in the first phases of the melt season.<p>
<p>
Soil moisture is an environmental descriptor that integrates much of the land
surface hydrology and is the interface for interaction between the solid Earth
surface and life.  As central as this seems to man's existence and
biogeochemical cycles, it is a descriptor that has not had wide spread
application as a variable in any land process models.  There are two primary
reasons for this.  It is a difficult variable to measure, not at one point in
time, but in a consistent and spatially comprehensive basis.  Also, it exhibits
very large spatial and temporal variability; thus point measurements have had
very little meaning.  The practical result of this is that soil moisture has
not been used as measurable variable in any of our current hydrologic,
climatic, agricultural, or biogeochemical models.<p>
<p>
Both passive microwave and active microwave (SAR) techniques have 
provided
solid theoretical and experimental results that the top five cm of soil
moisture can be measured from aircraft and space platforms under a variety of
environmental conditions and through a moderate vegetation cover (<a
href="fig3.1.gif">Figures 3-1</a>, <a
href="fig3.2.gif">3-2</a>).  This section will define the science
issues and application opportunities that can be addressed by microwave 
remote
sensing of soil moisture and snow water equivalence, describe the capabilities
and limitations of the passive and SAR systems, describe the progress to date
and document the research still needed to take this technology to an
operational status.<p>
<p>

<a name="RTFToC22">BACKGROUND</a><p>
<p>
The scientific objectives related to snow and ice identified by the National
Research Council are:<p>
<p>
*	To study the global hydrologic cycle to determine the distributions,
dimensions, properties, and relevant dynamics of snow, sea and lake ice, ice
sheets and shelves.<p>
<p>
*	To determine and understand the mechanisms for the transfers of water 
between
the major global reservoirs (glacier flow, melting, and freezing).<p>
<p>
*	To predict on appropriate time scales the distributions, volumes, and 
fluxes
associated with snow cover, sea ice, ice sheets and shelves, ground ice, and
permafrost.<p>
<p>
Although snow and ice phenomena play important roles in global processes,
difficult access hampers data collection, and conventional studies of snow and
ice cannot address the correct scales of most phenomena. In situ sampling
methods have limited utility for capturing the spatial and temporal variability
of snow and  ice processes.  Operational hydrology and climatology require
timely measurement of snow-pack parameters.<p>
<p>
The redistribution of solar energy over the globe is central to studies in
climate.  Water serves a fundamental role in this redistribution through the
energy associated with evapotranspiration, the transport of atmospheric water
vapor, and precipitation.  Residence time for atmospheric water is on the order
of a week, and for soil moisture, from a couple of days to months, which
emphasize the active nature of the hydrologic cycle.  Understanding the
importance of the land-surface hydrology to climate has  emerged as an
important research area since the mid 1960s when researchers  at the
Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory placed a land hydrology component 
into
their general circulation model (GCM) (see Manabe et al., 1965; Manabe,
1969).<p>
<p>
As the sophistication of GCMs has increased, the role of the land  surface
component has become more and more important.  However, a major  weakness 
in
the current GCMs is, according to the CES-89 report, "the  adequate
parameterization of variables representing the terrestrial phase of the
hydrologic cycle..., which is primarily the result of totally inadequate
information concerning the degree of spatial variability of  precipitation,
evapotranspiration, and other components of hydrology."  This report goes
further to say "the lack of regional-scale measurements  introduces a severe
shortcoming in the testing of GCM output." <p>
<p>
Perhaps the most important role that the land surface component of  a GCM
performs is the partitioning of incoming radiative energy into  sensible and
latent heat fluxes.  The major factor involved in determining  the relative
proportions of the two heat fluxes is the availability of  water, generally in
the form of soil moisture.  A number of  modeling studies have demonstrated 
the
sensitivity of soil moisture  anomalies to climate (Walker and Rowntree, 1977,
Rowntree and Bolton, 1983,  Rind, 1982, Shukla and Mintz, 1982, Delworth and
Manabe, 1989).   Researchers have reported, for instance, that soil moisture is
the  second most important forcing function, second only to the sea surface
temperature in the mid latitudes, and it becomes the most important forcing
function in the summer months.  <p>
<p>
The role of soil moisture is equally important at smaller scales. Recent
studies with mesoscale atmospheric models have similarly demonstrated a
sensitivity to spatial gradients of soil moisture.  For example, Fast and
McCorcle (1991) have shown that soil moisture gradients can induce thermally
induced circulations similar to sea breezes.  Chang and Wetzel (1991) have
concluded that the spatial variations of vegetation and soil moisture affect
the surface baroclinic structures through differential heating, which in turn
indicate the location and intensity of surface dynamic and thermodynamic
discontinuities necessary to develop severe storms.  In yet another study,
Lanicci et al., (1987) have shown that dry soil conditions over northern Mexico
and variable soil moisture conditions over the southern Great Plains can
dynamically interact to alter prestorm conditions and subsequent convective
rainfall patterns.<p>
<p>
It is still unclear whether the spatial distribution of soil moisture collected
at regional scales is useful for GCM and mesoscale modeling.  One indication in
favor is the recent study by Betts et al.,  (1994) showing that initialization
of ECMWF weather predictions on current soil moisture (during the summer of
1993 in the US Great Plains region) can lead to improved rainfall predictions.
The extreme wetness conditions, in comparison to climatological average soil
moisture, clearly was a factor in the effect.  For more normal conditions, soil
moisture anomalies will vary with the spatial and temporal scales of rain
events--scales that may be meaningful to 4-dimensional data assimilations
(4DDA) and mesoscale modeling.<p>
<p>
Based on these studies and scales ranging from GCM to mesoscale, it appears
that soil moisture will be an important hydrologic variable for
hydrometeorological modeling and validation studies.  Because of the 
ubiquitous
nature of soil moisture in many disciplines, there are numerous potential
science applications for frequent and spatially comprehensive measurements 
of
soil moisture.  However, most of these will fit under the umbrella of the
following four science issues which are the highest priority:<p>
<p>
*	To understand the role of surface soil moisture in the partitioning of
incoming radiant energy into latent and sensible heat fluxes at a variety of
scales from mesoscale to GCM scale.<p>
<p>
*	To understand the relationship between the surface 5 cm of soil 
moisture
observable by microwave techniques and the total profile (1 m or  more) soil
moisture that is accessible to plants and transpiration to the atmosphere.<p>
<p>
*	To understand how spatial and temporal patterns of soil moisture are 
related
to the physical and hydrologic properties of soils.<p>
<p>
*	To understand how the spatial and temporal patterns of soil moisture 
can be
used to improve our ability to model runoff at a variety of scales and adapt
hydrologic models to areas of differing climate, biomes and soils, and
geology.<p>
<p>
With the potential for measuring soil moisture having been demonstrated, the
obvious question to ask is how might society use such soil moisture
measurements?  As in the science issues, there are four general areas in 
which
routine measurements of soil moisture could have major impacts on our
day-to-day lives:<p>
<p>
*	Improvements in medium range weather forecasting by incorporating 
measured
soil moisture on a 30-km grid on a daily basis.<p>
<p>
*	Agricultural applications would include on-farm uses for improving 
irrigation
scheduling and efficiencies, to improving crop yield modeling for both 
domestic
and foreign areas.  The scales of interest here would be 100 m to 1 km and
three to seven days.<p>
<p>
*	Water management applications require better quantification of water 
uses,
storages and runoff to monitor existing resources and to assist decision makers
in allocation of limited resources or coordination of relief efforts in times
of flooding.  The scales of interest here would also be 100 m to 1 km and three
to seven days.<p>
<p>
*	Climate models, particularly for annual and inter annual variability, 
need to
be able to represent the land surface hydrologic processes accurately.
Measured soil moisture can be used as a state variable and as a validity
measure for GCMs.  The scales of interest here are 1 to 10 km and 7 to 30
days.<p>

<a name="RTFToC23">ROLE
OF SAR
</a><p>
<p>
Satellite remote sensing has become increasingly important to hydrologists 
and
climatologists because the data provide information on the spatial and 
temporal
distributions of parameters of climatic and hydrologic importance: snow 
covered
area, surface albedo, snow water equivalence, and snow wetness (liquid water
content). For the seasonal snow cover, remote sensing improves the 
monitoring
of existing conditions and has been incorporated into several
runoff-forecasting and management systems. Visible and near-infrared 
sensors
have been used extensively to measure snow-covered area. While the signal in
this portion of the electromagnetic spectrum is sensitive to snow grain size
and impurities, it is not sensitive to wetness and is sensitive to water
equivalence only for shallow snow packs. In addition, cloud cover hampers 
data
collection from these sensors, so the opportunities for obtaining suitable data
can be infrequent. In addition to accurate measurements of snow extent and
albedo, forecasting of melt (at both continental and drainage-basin scales)
requires information about spatial and temporal distributions of snow water
equivalence and free liquid-water content.<p>
<p>
Passive microwave signals are sensitive to snow properties of hydrologic
interest. However, the spatial resolution of spaceborne passive microwave
sensors is much coarser than the natural scale of variation in mountainous
areas. Active microwave remote sensing has long promised the advantages of: 
(1)
all-weather day or night imaging capabilities; (2) high resolution suitable for
alpine regions; (3) sensitivity to most snow properties of interest to snow
hydrologists and climatologists. Over the last decade, major improvements in
technology from data acquisition and processing to quantitative interpretation
have put capabilities for advanced snow and ice measurements at our 
doorstep.<p>
<p>
For snow, recent studies (using SIR-C/X-SAR, AIRSAR, and ERS-1 data) have 
shown
a significant improvement in understanding and modeling the backscattering 
and
polarization properties as a function of snow-pack parameters. An accurate
algorithm to retrieve snow wetness, which indicates where and at what rate 
snow
is melting, has been developed and tested using C-band SIR C and JPL AIRSAR
data (<a href="fig3.3a.gif">Figures 3-3a</a>, <a
href="fig3.3b.gif">3-3b</a>). Thus, accurate information about the
spatial and temporal distributions and melting status of snow cover can be
provided for hydrological and climatic investigations and operations. Maps of
snow-covered area derived from SIR-C/X-SAR and AIRSAR now compare 
reasonably
well (85-90% accuracy) with those derived from visible imagery, which 
require
clear weather and daylight.<p>
<p>
For soil moisture, recent advances in remote sensing technology have
demonstrated that soil moisture can be measured by a variety of techniques.
However, only microwave technology has the ability to quantitatively measure
soil moisture under a variety of topographic and vegetation cover conditions,
so potentially it could be extended to routine measurements from a satellite
system. A number of experiments using sensors mounted in trucks, aircraft, 
and
spacecraft have shown that the moisture within a thin layer of soil, on the
order of 5 cm,  can be accurately measured for bare soil and thinly vegetated
surfaces.<p>
<p>
<a name="RTFToC24">Soil
Moisture Remote Sensing
</a><p>
<p>
There are two basic microwave approaches that are typically used to measure
soil moisture.  One is passive (which is based on radiometry) and the other is
active and uses radar. Both approaches utilize the large contrast between the
dielectric constant of dry soil and water. At L-band, the dielectric constant
can vary from about 3 for dry soil to about 20 for wet soil, which can result
in a change in emissivity for passive systems from about 0.95 to 0.6 or lower
and an increase in the radar backscatter approaching 10 dB. There are also
major differences between the two systems in spatial resolution, swath width,
data rate, and power requirements. However, almost without exception, the two
systems are complementary; that<p>
is, strengths in one are matched by weaknesses in the other, and vice versa.
The advantages of passive microwave systems include frequent coverage, low 
data
rates, and (relative to active microwave) simpler data processing. The
disadvantages include poor resolution. In the case of the active microwave
systems, the advantages include high resolution, but this comes at the expense
of higher data rates and more complex processing.<p>
<p>
Measurements show that the estimated soil moisture for L-band frequencies
correlate best with soil moistures in the top 5 cm of the soil. The sensitivity
of active microwave sensors to soil moisture was demonstrated with many 
ground,
airborne, and even some spaceborne experiments ( Ulaby and Batlivala, 1976;
Ulaby, et al., 1978; Chang et al., 1980; Jackson et al., 1981; Wang et al.,
1986; Dobson and Ulaby, 1986; Lin et al., 1994a, b). Even though these
experiments have documented the sensitivity of the radar signal to soil
moisture, algorithms to invert radar measurements to infer soil moisture (Oh 
et
al., 1992; Dubois et al., 1994) must still be further evaluated over a broader
range of conditions.<p>
<p>
<a name="RTFToC25">Difficulties
in Soil Moisture Remote Sensing
</a><p>
<p>
A significant difficulty in remotely sensing soil moisture, either with active
and passive systems,  is the effect of target characteristics other than the
soil moisture; for example surface roughness, vegetation, and topography.  The
two most important target properties are surface roughness and those related 
to
the vegetation canopy.  Applying a backscattering model, Lin et al., (1994)
have studied the sensitivity of radar signals to various land surface
parameters; specifically for L-band (1.25 GHz)  over a short grass canopy they
found that the most important parameter appears to be the surface roughness.
In most natural settings, the effect of roughness may be equal or greater than
the effect of soil moisture on the radar backscatter.  Thus, the soil moisture
problem becomes one of determining the roughness effect independently so 
that a
model can be inverted to yield a soil moisture estimate.<p>
<p>
Surface Roughness Effects:  Improved understanding of surface scattering
processes is needed to further our understanding of the role of surface
roughness in soil moisture estimation.  Thus, theoretical surface
backscattering models have been developed for this purpose; namely, the 
small
perturbation model (SPM), the physical optics model (POM) and<p>
geometrical optics model (GOM).  In a broad sense, the geometrical optics model
is best suited for very rough surface, the physical optics model is suitable
for surfaces with intermediate scales of roughness, and the small perturbation
model is suitable for smooth surfaces.  In general, these models have not
provided good predictive values in field-scale observed soil moisture, and more
research is needed into surface scattering models.  Examples of recent work 
are
Fung et al. (1992) and Oh et al. (1992).<p>
<p>
The approach adopted by Oh et al. (1992) is based on scattering behavior in
limiting cases and on experimental data.  They have developed an empirical
model in terms of the root mean square (rms) roughness height, the wave 
number,
and the relative dielectric constant.  By using this model with multipolarized
radar data, the soil moisture content and the surface roughness can be
determined.  The key to this approach is that the co-polarization ratios
(HH/VV) and cross-polarization ratios (HV/VV) which are given explicitly in
terms of the roughness and the soil dielectric constant.  In more recent work
(Dubois et al., 1995), an algorithm was derived that uses L-band HH and VV
radar cross sections only to estimate surface roughness and soil moisture. In
this case, the algorithm was tested with both airborne and spaceborne SAR 
data
and accuracies of 3-4% absolute was found for surfaces with vegetation that 
has
a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) < 0.4.  Thus, initial
results look promising when applied to bare soil and sparse vegetation.  But,
current SAR satellite sensors (ERS-1/2 and RADARSAT) are both
single-polarization instruments (C-VV and C-HH, respectively), and even when
used together cannot provide cross-polarization ratios.<p>
<p>
<p>
Vegetation Effects:  The effect of vegetation is to attenuate the microwave
emission from the soil; it also adds to the total radiative flux with its own
emission. The degree to which vegetation affects the determination of soil
moisture depends upon the wavelength, the mass and water content of 
vegetation,
and the vegetation's structural characteristics as it influences its scattering
properties.   Thus, with radar the effect of the vegetation canopy adds more
complexity to the problem.  To infer soil moisture, one must determine the soil
roughness effects and  the effects of the vegetation canopy, which is a 
complex
inference problem and may not be unique without high temporal resolution 
data
in which only soil moisture is changing.   As with the roughness case, the
effect of vegetation on the active microwave sensing of soil moisture is
greatly dependent upon the instrument incidence angle, frequency, and
polarization. The vegetation contains water along and has plant structure.
Radar backscatter is sensitive to both of these characteristics (Lin et al.,
1994a).   Therefore, the radar backscatter from a vegetated surface will have
the integrated effect of the vegetation and underlying soil.<p>
<p>
Two general approaches have been used to model the volume scattering, the 
wave
approach and the intensity (or radiative transfer) approach. Both approaches
have their constraints, especially in dealing with complex vegetation
structures. Several groups are involved in research in the area of estimating
soil moisture from active microwave data in the presence of vegetation. Few
results have been presented or published, however. Saatchi et al. (1994) 
showed
that by using C-band and L-band data, the canopy water content of grasses in
the Konza Prairie could be estimated with an accuracy of about 20%, while Lin
et al. (1994) reported an accuracy of about 6% when estimating soil moisture
over grass covered areas in<p>
England.<p>
<p>
Assuming that the effects of vegetation could be accounted for in the case of
active microwave sensors, and given the fact that the best resolution than
could be expected from a spaceborne low frequency radiometer is on the order 
of
tens of kilometers, it is clear that SAR can play an important role in
providing remotely sensed surface soil moisture maps. The optimum radar
parameters based on the demonstrated algorithms would be a  polarimetric L-
band
radar system with a resolution on the order of 100 m. There is evidence that
suggests that inferring soil moisture in vegetated areas would require some
higher frequency SAR data, either C-band or X-band.  Continued research is
needed to help resolve the effectiveness of radar data for soil moisture under
different vegetation types and densities.  One approach is using multi-
temporal
data from a satellite platform, which may provide the long term data sets
necessary to isolate the fast-changing soil moisture effects from the slowly
changing vegetation and roughness effects.  Another promising approach is
combining the SAR radar measurements with a distributed hydrologic models 
to
infer soil moisture (for example Lin et al., 1994b).<p>
<p>
<a name="RTFToC26">Field
Measurements of Soil Moisture
</a><p>
<p>
When deciding the usefulness of the remote sensing instruments and the 
inferred
soil moisture estimates, one has to take into account the natural spatial
variability of soil moisture. Thus, when estimating the accuracy of a
technique, estimated and in situ measured values are typically compared. In
this way, areal averages from the remotely sensed data are compared to point
measurements, and the natural variation in the measured quantity becomes a 
very
important factor in judging the performance of a given technique.<p>
<p>
In most countries, there are a number of in-situ soil moisture measurements
taken in support of operational activities related to agriculture. Two examples
of such measurements programs are the Illinois State (U.S.) Soil Moisture
Program, an 18-site measurement network in operation since 1981; and the 
long
term soil moisture measurements in the former Soviet Union and reported by
Vinnikov and Yeserkepova (1991). Typically these measurements are taken 
using a
neutron probe, Time Domain Reflectivity (TD) instrument, or through
labor-intensive techniques such as gravimetric measurements. Also, typically
these are made on a three-day, weekly, or longer basis and in some cases (for
agricultural experiments) only during the growing season. For example the
current Illinois network makes biweekly samples during the growing season 
and
monthly samples at other times; the data reported by Vinnikov and 
Yeserkepova
(1991) were sampled at a monthly time interval.<p>
<p>
The in-situ measurements generally provide good definition with depth, 
usually
consisting of measurements every 5 or 10 cm throughout the root zone to 
depths
of one to two meters. Thus, the profile is well defined but there is usually
not an extensive spatial sampling to detect soil moisture gradients in the
horizontal plane. A number of investigators have looked into the spatial
variability of soil properties.  Rogowski (1972) found that over a range of
soils that the coefficient of variation in the distribution of water content at
15 bars was in the range of 15 to 35%; and for experimental hydraulic
conductivity was 5 to 68%. Hawley et al., (1982) investigated the effect of
sample volume on estimated soil moisture content. Using a 2m square plot and 
10
samples, the estimated CV was in the range of 5% for the three different soil
moisture conditions investigated; implying a CV of 15-20% for a single sample,
which is consistent with the other similar studies. In addition, they concluded
that samples greater than 200g (50 cc) are needed for accurate estimates.<p>
<p>
Field scale variability (16 ha, > 40 acres) was evaluated by Bell et al.,
(1980) using data collected in 57 fields in Arizona, Kansas, and South Dakota.
The nominal standard deviation of all the data analyzed was between 2 and 3%,
soil moisture. For remote sensing studies, this means that perfect correlations
to ground observations are unlikely and that the inherent error due to
field-scale variability is of the same order of magnitude as the demonstrated
accuracies of the inversion results for both active and passive microwave
instruments.<p>
<p>
While there are direct uses for the surface soil moistures, a much wider range
of research and applications would benefit from an estimate of the profile soil
moisture. Although there is still much work to be done in this area, some basic
concepts have been proven. Kostov and Jackson (Kostov, 1993) have identified
four general approaches: statistical, knowledge-based (a priori information),
radiometric inversion, and soil water modeling. Regional profile mapping 
using
a straightforward regression approach was demonstrated in Jackson et al.,
(1987). Knowledge-based approaches have been used extensively by Reutov 
and
Shutko (1986 and 1990) and also by Jackson (1980). Recent research has 
focused
on a combination of the inversion and modeling approaches (Entekhabi et al.,
1994). Each of these approaches needs to be considered in the development of
large scale mapping programs because any one in particular may not be
compatible due to limitations caused by ancillary data requirements or the
temporal and spatial sampling.<p>
<p>
<a name="RTFToC27">Radar
Observations for Soil Moisture
</a><p>
<p>
SAR satellites offer perhaps the best opportunity to measure soil moisture
routinely at regional scales.  Currently, the ERS-1 C-band (VV) and JERS-1
L-band SARs are operating, and the Canadian RADARSAT,  also C-band (HH), 
will
be launched in mid-1995.  Although it is believed that an L-band polarimetric
system would be optimal for soil moisture, the preliminary results from the
ERS-1 demonstrate its capability as a soil moisture instrument under ideal
conditions: bare soil, near saturation, constant roughness.  The main drawback
to the SAR systems is the lack of existing algorithms for the routine
determination of soil moisture.  However, through airborne and SIR-C remote
sensing experiments, field observations are accumulating for a diverse set of
sites.  It is hoped that these data are sufficient for developing suitable
algorithms.  It is critical that these diverse data sets be brought together in
a SAR soil moisture data base.<p>
<p>
Experimental data sets can be grouped into three classes, of which only one is
discussed in this report.  These classes are: (i) In-situ operational soil
moisture data sets, taken by water resources and agricultural agencies for a
variety of reasons.  Even though these data sets are important for hydrological
research, the lack of simultaneous remote sensing data make these soil 
moisture
measurements of limited value for the development of soil moisture remote
sensing algorithms. (ii) Remote sensing experiments with passive microwave
sensors.  Examples of these include HAPEX-MOBILHY (Hydrologic Atmospheric 
Pilot
Experiment and Modelisation du Bilan Hydrique) program in southern France 
in
1985; HAPEX-SAHEL in Niger (West Africa) in 1992; and the First ISLSCP Field
Experiment (FIFE) in Kansas in 1987.  (iii) Remote sensing experiments with 
SAR
and in some cases passive microwave sensors.  These experiments include:<p>
<p>
Mac-Hydro-90 in the Mahantango catchment (central Pennsylvania) in 1990 
which
was a multi-sensor  campaign (using the DC-8 with the three frequency
polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) ,and the C-130 carrying  the 
PBMR
L-band radiometer and the NS001 thematic mapper simulator.<p>
<p>
Washita-92, conducted over the Little Washita catchment in Oklahoma in 1992,
was another multi-sensor  campaign (using the DC-8 with the three frequency
polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), and the C-130 carrying the 
NS001
thematic mapper simulator, the Thermal Imaging Mapper, the Electronically
Steered Thinned Array Radiometer (ESTAR), a 37-GHz radiometer, and a USDA 
laser
profiler.)<p>
<p>
Mac-Europe-91, a multi-aircraft campaign DC-8 and EU-2 for remote sensing in
Europe during 1991.  Soil moisture data were collected at a number of sites
including Slapton Wood, Devon, England; Montespertoli, Tuscony, Italy; EFEDA
experiment in Spain.<p>
<p>
Shuttle Imaging Radar, SIR-C, flights in April and October 1994.  There were a
number of sites for which radar data were collected for soil moisture studies.
These sites included the Little Washita (OK, USA), Mahantango catchment (PA,
USA), Alcona (Manitoba, Canada), Zwalm catchment (Belgium), and 
Montespertoli
(Italy).<p>
<p>
It is critical that these data be made available to provide algorithm
developers a broader range of soil moisture data.<p>

<a name="RTFToC28">CURRENT
AND PLANNED SAR ASSETS AND THEIR USE
</a><p>
<p>
Several methods for mapping melting snow-covered regions have been  
developed
and tested using AIRSAR and ERS-1 imagery. Mapping wet snow and glaciers 
in
remote alpine regions using a conventional single-pass, single-polarization 
SAR
imagery requires an accurate Digital Elevation Model (DEM), but analysis of
time-series ERS-1 data sets showed significant improvement in mapping 
accuracy
and corresponding decrease in the need for a DEM. However, the capability of 
a
single-polarization SAR to study alpine snow is limited to map wet snow cover
only.  Furthermore, multi-frequency, multi-polarization SAR can effectively 
map
the extent of wet-snow regions without requiring any topographic 
information.
Numerical simulations show that a similar technique could map dry snow 
cover;
verification is ongoing. Thus, a multi-frequency, polarized SAR provides snow
mapping capability from small to large scales.  SIR-C/X-SAR also can map firn
regions, which indicates the regions of annual snow accumulation or of 
glacier
growth. This capability provides an important tool for mass-balance studies of
glaciers.<p>
<p>
The most fundamental snow cover property, in terms of water supply 
forecasting,
is the snow-water equivalence: the total amount of water the snow would yield
at a  point if it melted. This variable has been traditionally measured at
several hundred snow courses throughout the mountainous regions of the 
western
U.S. How to extrapolate these widely dispersed measurements remains a
fundamental problem in estimating the total water volume in the mountains.
Numerical simulations with multi-frequency, dual-polarization SAR have 
shown it
can monitor the spatial and temporal distributions of snow-water equivalence.
Data analysis with SIR-C/X-SAR is ongoing. With accurate estimates of
snow-covered area, detection of melting snow, and the measurement of the
spatial distribution of snow water equivalence, we will better understand the
most fundamental problems in snow hydrology: the spatial and temporal
distributions of snow properties in alpine regions.<p>

To derive the maximum benefit in terms of research or application out of
remotely sensed soil moisture, the remote sensing data must be integrated into
a geographic information system and analyzed taking into account the soil
properties and land characteristics.  Therefore, the required resolution of the
remotely sensed soil moisture data is related to the intended usage and the
ancillary data bases available for interpretation.  It makes little sense to
collect data globally at a resolution much higher than that of the ancillary
data.  It therefore appears that based on the range of projected applications
and the available ancillary data bases that a spatial resolution on the order
of 100 m to 200 m may be advantageous for processing and interpretation.  It is
true that the detail offered in higher resolution SAR data is interesting,
however, it does not seem to be really needed except for mapping and other 
less
time critical analyses.<p>
<p>
The timing and frequency of observation are very important in the valuation 
of
the remote sensing data for application and analysis.  Surface soil moisture is
diurnal in nature, generally decreasing during the day and rising slightly at
night (in the absence of precipitation).  The time of the observation will most
certainly be considered in its use.  Certain times of the day may offer certain
advantages.  For instance, to extrapolate a surface observation to the profile
using a physically based approach, Jackson (1980) has shown that a predawn
observation is advantageous.  In fact, late afternoon observations of surface
soil moisture using shorter wavelengths may provide little to no information.
An improvement in this single observation could be made by utilizing diurnal
changes, an a.m. and a p.m. observation.  For bare soils this could provide a
good estimate of the total surface flux during the day. Frequency of coverage
is a much more difficult subject.  Of course, this too is dependent on the
application.  It seems that daily coverage would be of greatest value for all
regions.  There is a significant sacrifice in increasing this, however, the
next plateau would be three days.  Observations at lower frequencies might 
only
be of selected value. <p>
<p>
Given this sampling requirement and the previous experimental results, it is
clear that the currently planned international SARs can provide little beyond
change detection for changing moisture conditions and mapping of wet alpine
snow cover only.  <p>

The recent results indicating that soil moisture and snow water equivalence
could indeed be measured accurately with spaceborne multiparameter SARs 
bring
the remote sensing one step closer to providing some important variables to
help understand and routinely monitor the hydrologic cycle.  However, even
though the status of SAR for measuring these quantities is very promising, it
is recognized that there are a number of logical steps to be taken in order for
the general scientific and public communities to benefit from this research. 
<p>
<p>
Given the previous experimental results, and the recent algorithms derived to
infer soil moisture and snow water equivalence, it is clear that single
frequency SARs can provide little beyond change detection for changing 
moisture
conditions.  It is highly doubtful whether even the magnitude of the change 
in
the soil moisture could be quantified from these types of single parameter SAR
measurements without a significant number of risky assumptions.  Therefore, 
the
logical conclusion is that the ultimate goal should certainly be an operational
spaceborne multiparameter SAR for routine soil moisture and snow water
equivalence mapping.  Recognizing that this is not likely to happen soon, we
therefore urge the continued support of the NASA multiparameter airborne 
SAR
program as a vehicle to continue the development and validation of soil
moisture, snow wetness, and snow water equivalence algorithms in the short 
term
with the long term goal the definition and launch of an operational SAR to
monitor these important variables of the hydrologic cycle.  Below we outline a
few steps we consider necessary to achieve this goal:<p>
<p>
(1)	Combine all data collected during AIRSAR and SIR-C/X-SAR campaigns 
and
analyze their ability to determine soil moisture empirically (sigma 0 vs.
measured soil moisture) and using all available algorithms.  Develop statistics
to define how large the errors are, what type of errors, and what conditions
the analysis or algorithms work or do not work well.  Using both US and 
foreign
campaigns should provide data from more than twenty sites and numerous
conditions.<p>
<p>
(2)	Continue a vigorous research program to extend current algorithms to 
infer
soil moisture from vegetated surfaces and to refine the snow water 
equivalence
algorithms.  The emphasis should be on well coordinated campaigns involving
both active and passive microwave instruments over a variety of different
terrain types.<p>
<p>
(3)	Examine the relationship between surface measurements and profile
measurements of soil moisture to evaluate the severity of the problem, if it
exists.  Data exist to address the following question:  How well can the
profile moisture be modeled if the surface 5 cm of soil moisture can be
measured every 3 days at a precision of <u>+</u>4% by volume?  What are the
performances of various models including simple regression models?<p>
<p>
(4)	Encourage land process modelers (mesoscale, GCM and runoff) to 
attempt to
use measured soil moisture and snow water equivalence from SIR-C/X and 
AIRSAR
campaigns in their modeling.<p>
