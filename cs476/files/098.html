<H2>Shaman Column Soul Retrieval </H2>

<H3>by Rick Gossett</H3>

<P>
Often, in dealing with traumatic incidents or situations, parts
of us get &#145;lost&#146; or disconnected, causing us to become
stuck emotionally.  An important element in the work of a shaman
involves the retrieval of this lost or disconnected part&#151;soul
retrieval.   Usually, the issues circle around abuse, molestation,
or early childhood trauma, and people say that they don&#146;t
feel whole, or that there seems to be a piece of them missing.
 And sometimes it relates to another person, for example a spouse
or parent who doesn&#146;t seem to ever have fully let go of the
attachment to their partner or child. 
<P>
These are all clues that soul loss has occurred. At stressful
or traumatic times in our lives a part of us decides to leave.
A soul part goes away out of fear, self-preservation, or even
confusion, and then becomes lost. Sometimes it may be stolen away
by another person and is unable to find its way home. In such
situations, we find ourselves going through life with limited
resources, with a hole in our soul. 
<P>
The work of the shaman begins as a person becomes aware of their
loss. Preparing to welcome back the wayward parts is the first
piece of the process, and the individual requires resources to
protect and care for those parts that may come home. And, as I
journey to retrieve their lost parts, I ask them if there are
any agreements or assurances they want me to carry.  
<P>
This preparation time is very important and often takes the form
of therapy&#151;either with me or another therapist who is comfortable
with shamanic work. It creates a safe haven for the returning
parts and lessens the possibility of any part leaving again after
the retrieval. It also begins the work of integrating those parts
back into the whole. 
<P>
Sometimes, when going into the Spirit world to retrieve soul parts,
I must negotiate with those parts which are wary about coming
back into what was as an abusive situation. For them, the world
has not changed since they left. They don&#146;t know that the
person has grown and now has the resources to take care of them.

<P>
The retrieval itself is much like finding a power animal for someone
else. This is done not by me, but by my own power animals. Often
the images that come to me don&#146;t make sense, but they have
meaning for the person involved. After the retrieval comes the
integrative phase of therapy. The person gets to know the returned
pieces, to find out what they need and expect, and what gifts
they bring back. Sometimes these parts bring a new sense of energy
and vitality; and sometimes they can bring disturbing memories.
Whatever the case, the individual is no longer stuck and can move
on in his or her life with a new sense of wholeness.
