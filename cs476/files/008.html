<FONT SIZE="+2">W</FONT>orking with the media can be the most credible, cost-effective
way to spread your message.
</P>

<P>
Face-to-face contact between your executives and members of the
media may sound scary, but it needn't be.  We'll show you how
to be comfortable with reporters - yes, even the most aggressive
ones.  We'll show you how the media can help you achieve your
goals - because we'll show how to help them achieve theirs.
</P>

<P>
You'll be working with some of the most highly acclaimed reporters
in California.  People who have been there:  Emmy award-winning
TV journalist
<A HREF="swatt.html">Steve Swatt</A>;
award-winning investigative reporters;
and top-level political press aides.
</P>

<P>
We'll show you what reporters really want - and how to give it
to them in a way that benefits your organization.  We'll show
you how to make good news newsworthy, and bad news flat and uninteresting.
</P>

<P>
Our media training for Orange County developer Kathryn Thompson
has helped her with numerous appearances on national television,
including Larry King Live.  Her effective performance has led
to invitations to White House press conferences.
</P>

<P>
Our extensive group media training for 500 leaders of the
<A HREF="cta.html">California Teachers Association</A>
was an important reason why the school voucher
initiative was defeated.
</P>

<P>
We trained each in the discipline necessary to control a volatile
political message.  We also showed them basic rules of the media
each would be working with.
</P>

<P>
Our trainees spoke to television, newspaper and radio reporters
with authority, passion and commitment.  They were the campaign's
biggest asset.  It showed up in the huge margin of victory on
election day.
</P>

<P>
We trained athletes and media spokesmen such as Los Angeles Dodger
Don Sutton, actor Dennis Franz, quarterback Steve Beuerlein and
former baseball player Jay Johnstone.
