This image of Fort Irwin in California's Mojave Desert 
compares interferometric radar signatures topography -- data 
that were obtained by multiple imaging of the same region  
to produce three-dimensional elevation maps -- as it was 
obtained on October 7-8, 1994 by the Spaceborne Imaging 
Radar-C/X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar aboard the space 
shuttle Endeavour.  Data were acquired using the  L-band (24 
centimeter wavelength) and C-band (6 centimeter wavelength).  
The image covers an area about 25 kilometers by 70 
kilometers (15.5 miles by 43 miles).  North is to the lower 
right of the image.  The color contours shown are 
proportional to the topographic elevation. With a wavelength 
one-fourth that of the L-band, the results from the C-band 
cycle through the color contours four times faster for a 
given elevation change.  Detailed comparisions of these 
multiple frequency data over different terrain types will 
provide insights in the future into wavelength-dependent 
effects of penetration and scattering on the topography 
measurement accuracy.  Fort Irwin is an ideal site for such 
detailed digital elevation model comparisions because a 
number of high precision digital models of the area already 
exist from conventional measurements as well as from 
airborne interferometric SAR data.
