		<B>Air Conditioning Feasibility Study</B>: Entech conducted a feasibility study of alternative cooling systems for the Merner-Pfeiffer Hall of Science.  Cooling systems evaluated consisted of: direct expansion units, air-source heat pumps, water-source 
heat pumps, chilled water and thermal storage (water and/or ice).  All systems were evaluated for construction costs, comfort, energy consumption, operating and maintenance costs, and expected useful life.  Feasibility study completed November 1992.

		<P><B>Mohn Hall</B>: Entech conducted an energy audit for Mohn Hall Dormitory.  The energy evaluation covered all energy systems inculding outside lighting.  Entech identified four Energy Conservation Opportunities (ECOs):<BR>

<UL>
<LI>Efficient fluorescent lighting
<LI>Incandescent to fluorescent lighting
<LI>Power Factor Correction
<LI>Replace Electric rooftop units with new gas rooftop HVAC unit.
</UL>

The estimated construction cost for the four ECOs was approximately $9,200.  The estimated annual savings were $3,200 for a 14% reduction from current energy expenditures resulting in a simple payback period of 2.8 years.<P>

Entech also completed and submitted an Energy Conservation Measure (ECM) grant application to the Pennsylvania Energy Office for Cycle XVI funding for the four (4) ECOs. If accepted, the grant would pay 50% of the engineering and construction costs involv
ed up to a maximum amount of $75,000.<P>
