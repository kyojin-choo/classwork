SCRIMP (Seeman Composite Resin Infusion Molding Process) is being tested as a hull forming method that reduces emissions and hand labor intensiveness.<p>

A recent NIST net posting discusses its status. The article is titled, <A href="http://spidey.nist.gov/atp/prev_comp/comp/9400/9402/94020033.htm">"High-Performance Composites for Large Commercial Structures" </A> describes an ongoing ARPA project..<p>

An <a href="http://sbir.gsfc.nasa.gov/95abstracts/06.01/951275.html">SBIR project involving SCRIMP</A> is also ongoing in the aircraft industry.<p>

A large sailboat has been built using the SCRIMP technology. Some nice photos of the construction are available on the web site <a href="http://paw.com/sail/jboats/j32updte.htm">http://paw.com/sail/jboats/j32updte.htm.<p>


<a href="5439635.htm">Patent 5,439,635</a> was recently granted for a bag used in the process.<p>

A basic article describing the current use of fiberglass in boat hulls, "Fiberglass: Just for the Hull of It" can be found in the July 27, 1995 issue of Machine Design on pages 54-58.<p>
