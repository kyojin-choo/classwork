MK WINS $200 MILLION ROLE IN NUCLEAR CLEANUP JOB AT INEL<p>
</b></center>

BOISE -- Morrison Knudsen Corporation (NYSE: MK), as part of a team led by 
BNFL Inc., will perform engineering and construction services totaling 
more than $200 million for the largest privatization effort ever 
undertaken at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL) by the
Department of Energy (DOE).<P>
     The total life cycle cost of the project will total $1.189 billion 
and involves the design, construction, and operation of the Advanced Mixed 
Waste Treatment Facility (AMWTP) to meet the milestones -- agreed to by 
DOE and the State of Idaho -- for getting nuclear waste out of Idaho.  In 
addition to Morrison Knudsen, the team led by BNFL Inc. includes: Science 
Applications International Corporation (SAIC), BNFL Engineering Ltd. 
(BEL), GTS Duratek, Manufacturing Sciences Corporation (MSC), Rocky 
Mountain Remediation Services, L.L.C. (RMRS), and Pajarito Scientific 
Corporation (PSC).<P>
     BNFL Inc. is the American subsidiary of BNFL, an international 
nuclear fuel-cycle and radioactive waste management services company 
headquartered in the United Kingdom.  BNFL brings 50 years experience in 
the design, licensing, construction and operation of private nuclear
facilities and has completed $12 billion in fixed-price capital projects 
since 1980.  BNFL Inc. has several contracts at DOE sites throughout the 
U.S.<P>
     In making the announcement, MK President and Chief Executive Officer 
Robert A. Tinstman noted that RMRS, jointly owned by MK and BNFL, is the 
environmental restoration and waste management contractor at the Rocky 
Flats Site in Colorado, where a majority of the waste to be treated at the 
INEL Advanced Mixed Waste Treatment Facility was produced. INEL's AMWTP
facility will treat at least 99 percent of approximately 65,000 cubic 
meters of transuranic and alpha wastes currently stored at INEL, and have 
additional flexibility and capacity to treat an additional 20,000 cubic 
meters of optional waste.<P>
     The facility's integrated treatment process will achieve an overall 
waste volume reduction of more than 65 percent, and will result in waste 
forms that can be accepted either by the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant 
(WIPP) or a low level waste storage/disposal facility.  To treat the 
plutonium-contaminated mixed waste at the INEL, the BNFL team will employ 
proven technologies from its Sellafield site in the United Kingdom, 
including two waste encapsulation plants and a waste treatment complex 
designed to treat plutonium-contaminated waste at much greater levels of 
contamination than the waste which will be treated at the INEL's AMWTP.<P>
     The AMWTP contract will be executed in three phases.  In Phase I,  
which extends through 1999, the BNFL Inc. team will obtain permits and the 
authorization basis for facility operations, and MK will assist in 
finalizing the design and business approach.  In Phase II, MK will manage
construction of the facility to meet the completion date of December 31, 
2002.  Phase III extends through 2015 and will entail plant operations, 
waste treatment, and transportation of the waste out of Idaho.<P>
<UL>
     <LI><B>Morrison Knudsen Corporation</B> has more than five decades of experience 
in the nuclear industry, including more than 40 years at the INEL.  MK 
will be responsible for all architectural, engineering and construction 
management services associated with the AMWTP.</LI>
     <LI><B>SAIC</B>, which has been a part of INEL since the 1970s, will provide all 
permitting and regulatory support, working with both the stakeholders and 
the regulators to ensure a safe and effective treatment facility is built 
and operated.</LI>
     <LI><B>BEL</B> will provide the BNFL team with expertise in the design of the 
highly advanced instrumentation and robotics technologies, as well as 
proven major nuclear engineering and project management experience.</LI>
     <LI><B>RMRS</B>, the waste manager at the Rocky Flats Site in Colorado, will 
support the BNFL team in bringing an unequaled knowledge of the waste 
characteristics -- the majority of the waste emanates from Rocky Flats -- 
as well as expertise in the areas of mixed waste treatment, storage, and 
disposal operations.  RMRS is jointly owned by MK and BNFL.</LI>
     <LI>Team members that will provide specialty technologies include:  <B>GTS 
Duratek</B>, selected for its unparalleled experience in commercial scale, 
radioactive waste vitrification; <B>MSC</B>, chosen for its unique, large-scale 
specialty metal melting and recycling capabilities; and <B>PSC</B>, which     
represents the leading edge in proven and unique waste characterization 
systems.</LI>
