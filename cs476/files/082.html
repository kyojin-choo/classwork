<h2>Turning the Tide of World Events</h2>
<h3>An interview with David Icke by Joseph W. Duggan</h3>

David Icke was a professional footballer for Coventry City and
later for Hereford before rheumatoid arthritis forced him to quit
amidst much publicity at the age of 21. He turned to journalism
and then to television, becoming a sports correspondent on BBC
2&#146;s Newsnight and contributing regularly to BBC 1&#146;s
Grandstand. He went on to become a national spokesman for Britain&#146;s
Green Party and became deeply involved in environmental issues.

<P>
A visit to a British medium and healer in 1990 set him on the
journey of discovery which dramatically changed his life and led
him to write a series of controversial books including Truth Vibrations,
It Doesn&#146;t Have To Be This Way, Heal The World, and The Robots&#146;
Rebellion. His most recent is And the Truth Will Set You Free
and has been described as the most explosive book of the 20th
century. It reveals the esoteric background to a worldwide conspiracy
to centralize power within the hands of a global elite. In it
he offers an inspiring spiritual solution in which every man,
woman and child can break free from robotic programming and take
back their power to decide their own destiny. 
<P>
Icke is travelling around the world explaining the danger to the
future of our planet posed by the present worldwide economic system
now dominated and controlled by a secret, global elite. The bottom
line of this &#145;system&#146; is &#145;economic growth&#146;
which economists claim leads to more jobs, more wealth (for the
elite), more economic &#145;success,&#146; etc. This couldn&#146;t
be more simple, but in truth it is a take, make and throw away
system which increases the rate and amount of irreplaceable resources
we take from the planet every year. It increases the speed at
which these products, most of which we don&#146;t need, are made
obsolete or wear out so that people are forced to buy the same
products again and again in order to generate ever greater increases
in production. This, in turn, leads to the increase in the amount
of natural resources now called waste and rubbish that we throw
away  every year.
<P>
It must have taken a genius to come up with it because, as Icke
says, &#147;It is the perfect environmental and human assassin
and yet it is the system that controls the world and the minds
of its people. In short, for the present system to survive and
increase production every year, it is essential that we rape the
planet for more and more resources and poison her with ever more
pollution. This is the system supported by every major political
movement in the world, except for the Greens. This is the conventional
&#145;wisdom&#146; that is destroying the earth. 
<P>
&#147;Also, in our present global system, individual countries
surrender control of their own destiny as other countries produce
cheaper products utilizing low-wage workers, and often new, but
environmentally and socially destructive technology. Unemploy-ment
rises in those countries which can&#146;t compete, but what of
those that do have jobs. They spend most of their time working
in factories and offices producing these trinkets to buy even
more trinkets that someone else is also spending their lives in
factories and offices making.
<P>
&#147;Whatever happened to living? The vast majority of people,
rich and poor, on this planet are enslaved&#151;enslaved by the
system&#146;s robotic programming, its economic imprisonment,
and by their own refusal to think, question and find the liberation
that comes with an open mind. We don&#146;t live in a free society,
we live as robots in a society in which you are free to do what
the society wants you to do&#151;produce and consume&#151;that&#146;s
the reality.&#148;
<P>
Icke has been able to carry out a detailed analysis which fits
together past and present world events which appear to occur independently
of each other, but in truth have the same people pulling the strings
in all of them. It&#146;s becoming increasingly true that a very
few people control the world by persuading and pressuring the
population through fear to think the way they want them to act
and think, or preferably, not to act or think independently at
all. Currently, four multinational corporations control 90% of
the global media.
<P>
He explains: &#147;What happens in practice is that if you look
at all the dogmas in all cultures, all societies have what I call
a &#145;hassle-free zone.&#146;  It is that area within any culture,
within each dogma (religious, economic, political etc) wherein
if you conform to it, you are in the comfort zone. No one&#146;s
going to laugh at you, condemn you for being different, or for
expressing your uniqueness, because you are locked into the herd
mentality, and you are conforming to what you are told you should
be and do. When you step out of this mindset and express your
unique aspect of all that exists and refuse to be frightened,
or controlled, you immediately face ridicule or condemnation as
I have in England.&#148;
<P>
In his talks, Icke connects and links conspiracy ideas with the
spiritual. He first  explains how we are giving our minds away
and the means through which we are conditioned to do that. He
discloses a vast number of names and organizations which are very
famous, and of people who are in the controlling hierarchy, including
the US President.  He says, &#147;I do not do this out of condemnation
because the people involved are expressing their own state of
being at the time, they are also reflecting back to us the collective
human mind itself and the results of our own lack of personal
responsibility and integrity. I think that it is important to
do this first.
<P>
&#147;I also point out how the same people on apparently different
sides of politics are actually connected to the same elite organizations.
These organizations have the same proven agenda of a world government,
a world central bank, a world army, a world currency, and some
say a microchipped population. These apparent opposites in politics
are there to persuade us that we are not living in a prison, that
we have a choice. Yet these persons are not opposites at all but
are part of a one-party state. The last two US Presidents were
apparently opposites and on different sides &#151;Bill Clinton
and George Bush&#151;yet they were both heavily involved within
the same elite organizations.
<P>
&#147;The media and politicians have a cozy unwritten agreement
that projects a myth to people which is that prime ministers,
presidents, and high-ranking politicians are the top of the decision-making
pyramid in the world. They then walk around the world stage and
act as if they are the final arbiters of power. The media goes
along with this which means that the echelons  above the Clintons,
who actually pull the strings, never get researched and investigated
because they are invisible to the public. These are the individuals
who decide who becomes president because they own the money and
the media. The President is only the most famous front-man in
the world.
<P>
&#147;This is also why movements for social, economic, and environmental
changes are ineffective. They are unable to change the system
because they are actually forced to be part of the system to survive.
All of their resources are expended on the front-men while the
real power acts subversively behind the scenes to perpetrate the
system as it is now. Also, through non-profit foundations operated
by the elite, many are infiltrated by agents who turn the movements
into vehicles to promote the system. Most activists attack the
elements of the system they can perceive with anger, blame, and
often violence. From a spiritual perspective, it is only possible
to transform the negative consciousness of the system with love
and compassion. This is why it is so necessary at this time to
move to a higher state of consciousness to solve our world problems.&#148;
<P>
A mass mind-controlling technique which is used by these elite
organizations all the time is the &#145;problem-reaction-solution.&#146;
A problem is covertly created (by the CIA, KGB, etc) and someone
is blamed for the problem. The culprit might be a war, a run on
the currency, national debt, or a government collapse. It can
be anything. The media is used to stimulate public opinion in
relationship to the created problem so that the public cries out,
&#147;Something must be done!&#148; At that point, those who created
the problem openly offer the solution as a means of getting what
they wanted all along. 
<P>
&#147;An example of this,&#148; Icke explains, &#147;is the world
army scenario. The last thing that the &#145;problem-reaction-solution&#146;
needed in Bosnia was an &#145;effective&#146; UN peace-keeping
operation. If it was effective, it would have been so in Rwanda
and Somalia, but then there would be no problem to solve. So,
as a result of the UN peace-keeping operation  not working, there
continued to be a problem. The UN peace-keeping was designed not
to work and was aided by the major peace negotiators in Bosnia
who incidentally are all members in the same elite organizations
that have as an agenda the creation of a world army.
<P>
&#147;The more horrific the pictures that came out of Bosnia,
the louder came the public outcry, &#147;Something must be done!&#148;
This was understandable from the public&#146;s point of view,
but the solution put forward was the formation of what is effectively
a world army, a 60,000-man force ... the largest multinational
force assembled since World War II and exactly what the conspirators
wanted.&#148;
<P>
Icke operates on two different levels, the here-and-now, the conspiratorial
research level to assess what is actually taking place, and the
spiritual which demonstrates that if you take your mind away,
there are physical consequences. He says, &#147;If we take our
personal and spiritual power back, stop being a herd of sheep
and express our unique, divine individuality, then the ability
of a few to control our world disappears. Once people realize
they can control their own lives, that their own power exists
within them rather than outside of themselves ... the game is
over for the global elite. You don&#146;t need a gun. You don&#146;t
need another political party. You don&#146;t need another smoke-filled
room, protest group, or rally. All you need is to celebrate your
uniqueness, de-link from the robotic herd mentality, and respect
everybody&#146;s right to do the same. Suddenly we have removed
the (energy) vehicle through which a global conspiracy can operate&#151;our
herd mentality.&#148;
<P>
Icke has also been working extensively with what he calls &#145;earth
energies&#146; and has travelled to Peru, Canada, Africa, and
over much of Europe, especially Britain, doing planetary healing
work. He explains, &#147;We are the custodians of Mother Earth
and have access to higher consciousness. We can act as facilitators
to heal and balance many of the disturbances in the earth through
a grid system known as ley lines and power spots. These power
spots act like acupuncture points on the earth&#146;s surface
and the ley lines as meridians and are easily disrupted by acts
of violence (war), toxic pollution, construction, etc. We have
the ability to work with higher consciousness to heal and balance
the earth.&#148;
<P>
When asked where he got all his information, Icke explained, &#147;Many
people within government and intelligence agencies as well as
the military have known for a long time what is going on, but
have not known what to do with the information. They are choosing
to give it to me because they know that I will put it out into
the world. I keep saying to people the worst thing that can happen
to me is that my consciousness moves to another time/space reality,
and that&#146;s the absolute worst thing that could happen! This
fear of death is probably the most effective means of control
the conspirators have. The truth is there is no death only the
movement of consciousness between infinite time/space realities.
We are in fact immortal, individualized units of consciousness.&#148;

<P>
David Icke will be in Vancouver and Victoria to present a lecture
and workshop on September 20-22. His lecture, &#147;The Truth
Will Set You Free,&#148; exposes the controlling interest groups
active in the world and what individuals can do to turn the tide
of world events. In his workshop he explains the methods used
by the controlling forces to prevent knowledge of our true spiritual
nature and the phenomenal power we have to create our own reality.
It is the suppression of this knowledge which has allowed the
control of the many by the very few. He gives techniques for breaking
free of robotic programming and methods of tapping into our true
spiritual potential. Earth healing techniques using meditation
and rituals will also be presented. Participants will be encouraged
to become part of a worldwide group of individuals dedicated to
healing themselves and Mother Earth.
<P>
David Icke will also be speaking at the Shared Vision breakfast
on September 20. For more information call (604) 731-3042.
