<h2>Summer Salads</h2>
What can be more appetizing on a hot summer&#146;s day than a
plateful of crisp, colourful vegetables.  Salads offer a great
way of incorporating essential omega 3 fatty acids by using cold-pressed
oils such as flax, canola, soybean or walnut in dressings. When
used as  main dishes, they can also include a light source of
protein, such as sprouted beans, or nuts and seeds.
<h2>Selecting Vegetable Oils for Salads</h2>

<P>
Extra virgin olive oil: The full-bodied, first press without chemicals
or heat is the best. All  other types are poorer quality and can
be lighter in flavour. Contains natural beta sistosterol, vitamin
E, and other anti-oxidants. Does not need refrigeration. Found
in supermarkets or natural food stores.
<P>
Flax oil: A great source of essential omega 3 fatty acids for
vegans or others who don&#146;t eat fish. Available in natural
food stores, the best and richest form is cold pressed. The container
should be dark to minimize light peroxidation. Look for the expiry
date and always refrigerate, or freeze for longer periods. Cold-pressed
oils should not be heated excessively, and are best used with
salads, and on cooked vegetables or grains.  The wonderful flax
oil dressing included here goes particularly well with green salads
composed of young greens such as mustard greens, kale, Dutch endive,
French sorrel and watercress&#151;sliced match-stick thin.
<MENU>
<LI>Basic Flax Oil and Vinegar Dressing
<LI>The flax oil in this recipe gives a nutty flavour. Add a little
mayonnaise for a dip.
<LI>&#189; cup flax oil
<LI>3 tbsp lemon juice, rice or cider vinegar
<LI>3 tbsp water
<LI>2 to 3 medium cloves garlic
<LI>&#189; tsp sweetener (maple syrup, honey)
<LI>1 tsp Dijon mustard
</MENU>

<P>
Optional:
<MENU>
<LI>1 tsp light miso
<LI>1 tsp tamari soy sauce
<LI>&#189; tsp ground cumin or curry powder
</MENU>

<P>

<P>
Place ingredients in blender. Puree until smooth. Cover and refrigerate
for up to one week. Makes about &#190; cup. Olive or canola oil
can be substituted for the flax oil. To make a herb dressing,
add 2 tbsp chopped fresh or 1 tsp dried herbs.

<h2>California Sushi Salad</h2>

<P>
Here&#146;s a novel salad that&#146;s fun to use as an appetizer.
Seaweeds supply minerals such as iron, calcium and magnesium.
To pickle ginger, slice it very thinly and place it in hot seasoned
rice vinegar for at least two hours. Allow to cool and refrigerate.
It turns a delicate pink colour.
<MENU>
<LI>1-1/2 cups short- or medium-grain white rice
<LI>&#189; cup finely-chopped carrots

<LI>(or &#188; cup rice vinegar and 1 tbsp sugar)

<LI>1/3 cup thinly-sliced green onion
<LI>5 or 6 large butter lettuce leaves, rinsed 
<LI>and crisped

clear; drain. Add 1-1/2 cups water to rice. Cover; bring to a
boil over high heat. Reduce heat to low and cook for ten minutes.
<P>
Sprinkle carrots over rice. Cook, covered, until rice is tender
to bite&#151;about five minutes. Stir vinegar into rice and spread
out in a 10 x 15 inch pan. Turn rice often with a wide spatula,
then let cool. Mix cucumber and onion with rice. If making ahead,
cover for up to three hours.
<P>
Divide the sushi rice among five or six  lettuce-lined plates.
Spoon the rice on nori or lettuce, add condiments to taste, and
wrap to eat.
<P>
Condiments:

Avocado, peeled, pitted, sliced and dipped in flavoured rice vinegar;
your favourite sprouts; bite-sized asparagus steamed and cooled;

<h2>EarthSave News &amp; Views</h2>

The dairy industry has bought a large soy milk company&#151;
Pacific Soy&#151;which is currently producing soy milk for other
soy industries. They have asked the Canadian government to allow
this soy milk to be fortified with B12, zinc, calcium and
vitamin D. With this industry  supporting such a request, we are
likely to see fortified products on the market by the autumn.
This manoeuvre will provide more opportunity for vegans, or those
who choose not to use cow&#146;s milk, to conveniently obtain
adequate amounts of these nutrients.
