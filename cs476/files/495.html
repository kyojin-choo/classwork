worked intensely to reach and agreement for a Production Sharing
Contract which fulfills the objectives of protecting the interest
of the Ecuadorian Government and its people as well as the
interest of the Parties of Block 16.</p>
<p>YPF Ecuador, Inc. and YPF S.A. celebrate the successful
achievement of the negotiations, and at the same time would like
to manifest their willingness to continue working and investing
in Ecuador within the established legal framework.</p>
