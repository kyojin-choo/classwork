<P> 
These two false-color composite imges of the Mammoth Mountain 
area in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, Calif., show significant 
seasonal changes in snow cover.  The image at left was acquired 
by the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C and X-band Synthetic Aperture 
Radar aboard the space shuttle Endeavour on its 67th orbit on 
April 13, 1994.  The image is centered at 37.6 degrees north 
latitude and 119 degrees west longitude.  The area is about 36 
kilometers by 48 kilometers (22 miles by 29 miles).  In this 
image, red is L-band (horizontally transmitted and vertically 
received) polarization data; green is C-band (horizontally 
transmitted and vertically received) polarization data; and blue 
is C-band (horizontally transmitted and received) polarization 
data.  The image at right was acquired on October 3, 1994, on 
the space shuttle Endeavour's 67th orbit of the second radar 
mission. Crowley Lake appears dark at the center left of the 
image, just above or south of Long Valley.  The Mammoth Mountain 
ski area is visible at the top right of the scene. The red areas 
correspond to forests, the dark blue areas are bare surfaces and 
the green areas are short vegetation, mainly brush.  The changes 
in color tone at the higher elevations (e.g. the Mammoth 
Mountain ski area) from green-blue in April to purple in 
September reflect changes in snow cover between the two 
missions.  The April mission occurred immediately following a 
moderate snow storm.  During the mission the snow evolved from a 
dry, fine-grained snowpack with few distinct layers to a wet, 
coarse-grained pack with multiple ice inclusions.  Since that 
mission, all snow in the area has melted except for small 
glaciers and permanent snowfields on the Silver Divide and near 
the headwaters of Rock Creek.  On October 3, 1994, only 
discontinuous patches of snow cover were present at very high 
elevations following the first snow storm of the season on 
September 28, 1994.  For investigations in hydrology and land-
surface climatology, seasonal snow cover and alpine glaciers are 
critical to the radiation and water balances.  SIR-C/X-SAR is a 
powerful tool because it is sensitive to most snowpack 
conditions and is less influenced by weather conditions than 
other remote sensing instruments, such as Landsat. In parallel 
with the operational SIR-C data processing, an experimental 
effort is being conducted to test SAR data processing using the 
Jet Propulsion Laboratory's massively parallel supercomputing 
facility, centered around the Cray Research T3D.  These 
experiments will assess the abilities of large supercomputers to 
produce high throughput SAR processing in preparation for 
upcoming data-intensive SAR missions.  The images released here 
were produced as part of this experimental effort.
