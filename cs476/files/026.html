<H2>In Search of the Beloved</H2>
<h3>on the Tantric Trail<br>
by Bryan and Light Miller</h3>
<P>

We live our lives in quiet desperation, looking for something
or someone outside ourselves to somehow fulfill  us. Even as we
search for the mythical Mr or Mrs Right, we operate from a degree
of self-loathing, created by misinformation, misconceptions, conditioning
and guilt.
<P>
How can we love or be loved if we don&#146;t love ourselves? 
How can we break the grip of our past to create a glittering new
reality?  Fortunately, our modern dilemma is ancient.  It has
been the challenge of all peoples in every age. Tantra offers
a solution, in the search for the beloved.
<h2>Ancient wisdom for modern healing</h2>

<P>
From within the legalized structure and rigidity of Hindu society,
emerged a group of rebels who believed that personal and human
evolution lay beyond the restrictions of traditional castes and
laws.  They proved that freedom could produce excellence while
legislation only produced stagnation.  They became masters of
themselves, discarding moribund traditions for self-knowledge.
They included scientists who postulated atomic structure, astronomers
who understood the solar system, mathematicians who created the
concept of zero, negative numbers and the decimal place, and metaphysicians
who discovered the aura, astral travel and the chakras. They became
masters of every craft and art.  They called themselves Tantrics,
which refers to expansion and the weaving of energy. Their wisdom
is a gift of 3,000 years. By rejecting empty ritual and rigid
dogma, they were able to recapture the true essence of Hinduism.
<P>
Tantra and Hinduism both utilize a triad of forces to be used
by the seeker: creation, transcendence and preservation. These
forces symbolize steps, realizations or stages of initiation for
the Tantra practitioner in the search for the beloved.
<h2>Brahma the Creator</h2>

<P>
The creative force is symbolized by Brahma and his female counterpart
Saraswati the patroness of the 64 Tantric arts.  Our creative
forces are given birth in artistic expression, especially in the
art of love. Tantra sees our body and the expression of the senses
as a way of producing energy to be redirected inwards and channelled.
 Healing our thoughts and feelings about sensuality and our bodies
is an important first step in producing this energy.
<h2>Vishnu the Sustainer</h2>

<P>
The second Tantric force is deified by Vishnu the Preserver and
his counterpart Lakshmi. He maintains life and propagates love.
 Laksmi is the embodiment of material prosperity and spiritual
wealth. Tantra teaches techniques for maintaining heightened sensual
awareness using secret rituals, positions, visualization, mantras
and yantras.
<h2>Shiva the Transcendental</h2>

<P>
The third principle is transformation as symbolized by Shiva (Lord
over Death) and his counterpart Kali (the Destroyer of Illusion).
 The universe is constantly chan-ging; nothing remains static.
 Transcendence or &#145;going beyond&#146; the limitation of ordinary
existence is the embodiment of Tantra and is revealed through
sexual secrets. In learning how to extend from the mundane to
the metaphysical, the lover takes the sexual energy created with
his beloved and transforms it into a life wave, a force transcendental,
to achieve liberation from death into pure undifferentiated consciousness.
<h2>Inner channels - chakras</h2>

<P>
Tantra literature elaborately describes the human energy system.
 Sadhanas or practices are prescribed for the initiated to experience
the movement of this energy.  Universal force enters through the
top of the head and is distributed down and out through the body
in a series of channels (Nadis).  Our perception of the changing
world of Maya (illusion) is created when this energy is directed
outwards through our senses (sight, hearing, smell, taste and
touch). Tantra practices involve withdrawing this energy from
the outer illusions and redirecting it upwards as awakened (Kundalini)
energy through a channel called the inner flute. A series of wheel-like
inner vortices called chakras intersect with this main channel.
The inner traveller can experience transformation and connections
with other realities at these stages as this energy is redirected
upwards. When the energy again reaches the crown of the head,
it becomes ultimately transformed into the nectar of immortality,
producing inner erotic ecstasy.  This experience of Samadhi is
the objective of the Tantric seeker.
<h2>Mantras - cosmic sounds</h2>

<P>
Mantra is an important component in Tantric work.  A mantra is
a primordial sound which can be repeated to produce a cumulative
stream of focused cosmic and bodily energy for specific purposes.
Om is the sound that created the universe and its continuation
resonates and maintains all existence. Om is the sound of true
love and, when chanted, it calls forth the beloved. The sound
Hrim evokes resonance in the all-embracing heart chakra. Klim
focuses the energy created in sexual union. 
<h2>Yantra - sacred symbols</h2>

<P>
Yantra is a linked diagram by which visualized and meditated energies
are focused. Yantras assist the Tantric practitioner in becoming
one-pointed. Around the border, there are typically gates of entrance
leading to a succession of patterns representing stages of atunement
(often with accompanying deities), projecting towards a central
point (symbol or mantra). When the upward (phallic) triangle of
the Shiva, Brahma and Vishnu is united with the downward (pubic)
goddess triangle of Lakshmi, Saraswati and Kali, they form a symbol
of male and female forces within&#151;symbolizing, in many cultures,
the connection to God.
<P>
Tantra teaches that our path begins as an inner journey. The work
we initially are presented with is the movement and purification
of our subtle energies. When the seeker is ready, however, the
Beloved will appear as that counterpart, other half, partner,
soulmate, who can join with you energetically to create cosmic
energy, sustain it and transform it to the liberating elixir of
eternal bliss and consciousness. Tantra&#146;s gifts of mantra,
yantra, sacred sex, the chakras and meditation are tools in the
liberation from the illusions of the world and signposts in the
search for the Beloved.
