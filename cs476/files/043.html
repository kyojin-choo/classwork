INDONESIAN SKIES OPEN

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

JAKARTA - Indonesia has extended a full open skies policy to
Association of South-east Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries in a move
to encourage development in two east Indonesian provinces
Kalimantan and Sulawesi, Brunei, Malaysia and the Philippines.

Minister of transportation, Mr Haryanto Dhanutirto, told parliament
the facility will cover only point-to-point services and not
stopovers to overseas destinations. Airlines from Brunei, Malaysia
and the Philippines, partners of the East Asia Growth Areas (EAGA),
can now link the major cities in Kalimantan and North Sulawesi.

TOURISM CO-OPERATIVE

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

By Gina Putong

HONG KONG - Tourism authorities in Hong Kong are strengthening co-
operative marketing promotions with the territory's counterparts in
China.

Hong Kong Tourist Association (HKTA) chairman Mr Lo Yuk Sui said
Pearl River Delta Tourism Marketing Organisation initiatives are
being expanded.

Mr Lo reminded HKTA's annual general meeting of the tourism
industry's role as the second largest foreign exchange earner for
the territory's economy.

He said: "(Hong Kong) is assured of a positive future as China's
most open window on the world. We are now planning to expand our
Pearl River Delta Tourism Marketing Organisation initiative and
will also be co-operating as fully as possible with next year's
'Visit China Year 1997'."

He said joint efforts would be undertaken with the China National
Tourism Administration (CNTA) for exhibition booths, travel trade
shows and promotions of cruise hubs.

Ms Amy Chan, HKTA executive director, expressed confidence that
with verbal reassurances from Chinese officials that visa and
travel policies "should more or less remain the same", the industry
would continue to flourish after the handover next year.

ASIA HAILS NEW LEISURE ALLIANCE

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

By Jeff Zuckerberg

HONG KONG - Executives of Thomas Cook in Asia have welcomed their
company's plans to form what they claim is the world's largest
leisure travel alliance with the giant American Automobile
Association (AAA).

Ms Keller Mak, general manager of Thomas Cook Hong Kong, said:
"This alliance will be a big incentive for people in Hong Kong or
elsewhere in Asia to travel with Thomas Cook when travelling to the
US. And this is a large sector of our business.

"We are leisure travel specialists, with over 30 per cent of our
business being travel to the US."

The alliance - which becomes fully operational on January 1 next
year - provides all leisure travellers who make international
arrangements through AAA access to the Thomas Cook "Worldwide
Customer Promise".

The Worldwide Customer Promise includes the following no-fee
services for holidaymakers: airline reservation changes, ticket
revalidation or rerouting, hotel and car rental reservations,
changes to travel arrangements and travel planning; and emergency
local telephone calls.

AAA will provide reciprocal services to Thomas Cook customers in
the US.

In addition to enhanced customer service, the AAA-Thomas Cook
alliance will focus on new technology applications and electronic
distribution.

The first joint project begins in January when AAA joins the
Catalist Trading Exchange.

Catalist is an electronic leisure travel booking system developed
by Thomas Cook, which integrates into AAA's new AVATAR system.

The system allows travel counsellors to create electronically-
customised vacations for independent or group travel.

"AAA's alliance with Thomas Cook allows the association to deliver
unparalleled customer service far beyond its borders," said Mr
Graeme Clarke, senior vice- president, AAA products and services.

"Today's announcement provides AAA members the same level of
security and peace of mind whether they are visiting Boston,
Britain or Beijing."

Future initiatives for the partners will include negotiations with
multinational suppliers and co-operative ventures in foreign
exchange and publishing.

IHA'S SPEARMAN RETIRES TO SPAIN

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

THE International Hotel Association (IHA) will bid farewell to Mr
Robin Spearman on September 21 when he retires to the Costa Del Sol
in Spain.

Mr Spearman has headed the Hong Kong office of the IHA since it
opened in May 1995.

Mr Andrew Jones, vice-president of human resources at the Marco
Polo Hotel, will take over Mr Spearman's position commencing
October 1.

After 21 years with Hilton International, Mr Spearman came to Hong
Kong in 1989 to head human resources at Holiday Inn Asia Pacific.

It was a very demanding position because with seven hotels in
China, Holiday Inn was hit hard in the aftermath of the Tiananmen
Square incident.

Mr Spearman was responsible for overseeing the evacuation of its
expatriate personnel from China and then subsequently rebuilding
that infrastructure.

While in Hong Kong, he was also chairman of the human resources
committee of the IHA, chairman of the advisory board for Hong Kong
Technical College and a member of the advisory boards for the hotel
programme at the Hong Kong Polytechnic and for PATA.

"I am very sad to be leaving Hong Kong," he said. "There's a family
feeling here in the hotel industry. But I'll be back next year -
either for the Cricket Sixes or for the handover."

Mr Spearman plans to take it easy for the next few months before
possibly teaching at a new hotel school in Spain.

FOREIGN INVESTMENT GROWING

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

LICENCE has been awarded to Cantho Tourism and France's Electricite
et Eau de Madagasca for a US$4.2 million joint venture hotel
project in the Mekong Delta town of Cantho.

This will be the second hotel project for the French company, which
recently secured the first licence issued since early 1994 for a
100 per cent foreign-invested hotel project in Sapa.

Also considering investment outside Vietnam's mainstream
destinations is the Malaysian company of Goh Hock Guan, which has
signed an agreement for a US$12 million hotel development in Hoa
Binh.

Goh Hock Guan has, in the past, expressed interest in projects in
both Ha Long Bay and Hue, neither of which has seen any progress,
but Hoa Binh authorities express confidence in the company's
commitment to the Hoa Binh project. The second stage involves
constructing a golf course.

Saigontourist, meanwhile, is seeking foreign investment for a
health and spa resort in the province of Binh Chau.

LAOS CONTINUES TO DEVELOP

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

HOTELS are springing up all over Vietnam. Hanoi has 26 hotels under
development, while Ho Chi Minh City has 23. Danang and China Beach
are also sites for new hotel projects.

One of these new hotels has already started accepting bookings for
16 of its eventual 40 rooms.

It is the first foreign joint venture property to be built in the
former French retreat area of Tam Dao, 80km outside Hanoi. Other
hotels that have soft opened are the five-star Hanoi Daewoo and Na
Trang Lodge, the first international standard hotel in Na Trang.

Vietnam already has 26,000 international standard hotel rooms.

About 11,000 of these rooms were supplied by 160 joint ventures.
One of the first joint ventures is the three-star Century Riverside
Hotel Hue, managed by Century International Hotels since 1992.

  Meanwhile, the go-ahead has been given for a US$209 million joint
venture development project on a site overlooking the former US
embassy in central Ho Chi Minh City.

  The Asian Plaza Complex is expected to be completed by the turn
of the century.

CAMBODIANS HOLD TREK TOURS

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

OPERATORS hoping to open new destinations in Cambodia's north-
eastern corridor, marketing the allure of untouched hill tribes,
will have to wait say members of Cambodia's travel trade.

Trekking tours to Modulkiri and Ratanakiri might inspire a
pioneering spirit in the hardest of backpackers, but mainstream
travel companies are cautious about the area's immediate potential.

This is in spite of an aggressive stance from Cambodia's Ministry
of Tourism which would like to promote new destinations. Both
provinces were spared during years of conflict, are reportedly free
of mines and offer cross border opportunities for selling packages
into northern Vietnam.

"We've seen the success of eco-tourism in neighbouring countries
and now we want to promote the natural, cultural and environmental
advantages in these areas," said under-secretary of state for
tourism, Mr Sok Chenda Sopea.

Local tour operators remain indifferent about sending clients to
destinations off Cambodia's beaten track.

"It is often mentioned but it is not ready for groups,' said Ms
Nongnuj Dobbs, Phnom Penh office manager for East-West Cambodia.

Lack of infrastructure, and only four weekly flights by Royal Air
Cambodge limit short-term development potential.

VIETNAM: AIRPORT INVESTMENT GROWING

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

A RENOVATED domestic arrivals hall has opened at Hanoi's Noi Bai
International Airport and work is underway on a new US$60 million
terminal building, scheduled for completion by end 1997.

Doubts have been raised over expected Japanese involvement in the
project, and a Civil Aviation Administration of Vietnam (CAAV)
official said the government will finance the initial stages.

An agreement has been signed with the German firm, Thyssen, for the
supply and installation of terminal equipment. Under the deal, a
loan of about US$17 million will be provided.

Meanwhile, in Ho Chi Minh City, five foreign firms are competing
for investment in a new terminal building for Tan Son Nhat
International Airport. The building will allow Vietnam's main
gateway to be upgraded to an eight million-pax capacity.

Sources have suggested that departure taxes are likely to be raised
at both airports to cover costs.

And Royal Brunei Airlines has begun its twice-weekly Boeing 747
service between Myanmar and London.

The flights leave Brunei on Mondays and Thursdays and stop over in
Yangon and Abu Dhabi before proceeding to London's Heathrow
airport.

COMFORTABLE CHAOS IN HANOI

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

AN oasis of green-shuttered calm, a city of enchanting lakes and
crumbling French architecture, the refined older sister to an
explosive young Ho Chi Minh City - these are some of the images of
Hanoi trotted out by Vietnam guidebooks.

You should not believe it. From the vantage point of a cyclo
(rickshaw) tour through Hanoi's ancient quarters, it was clear to
me that Vietnam's capital is anything but peaceful. Life is lived
out at full throttle as motorcycles seem to hoot their way not just
around you, but over and under you, in their impatience to get on
with life.

I had insisted we travel only by the ubiquitous cyclo - still a
leading form of transport outside Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. But I
hadn't bargained for the aftermath of typhoons Frankie and Nicki,
which left me knee-deep in water before I had even reached the
rendezvous.

When I finally arrived, my guide, Mr Hieu, was all smiles - and so
was I when I found he had lined up a car as well as a couple of
cyclos for us.

First stop for visitors to Hanoi is usually the Ho Chi Minh
Mausoleum, a fascinating if somewhat eerie monument housing the
embalmed body of the former leader affectionately known as Uncle
Ho.

It was Thursday and the mausoleum was closed. We headed instead to
the modernist, Russian-built Ho Chi Minh Museum for a quick tour of
the former leader's life. The exhibits are interesting but the
English language is scarce so a guide is much needed.

Next stop was the One Pillar Pagoda where we interrupted
preparations for a ceremony honouring a leading monk who had
recently died. Later we saw the charming Tran Quoc Pagoda
overlooking West Lake and the White Horse Pagoda where a white-
bearded monk talked about travel writer Barbara Cohen.

Hanoi's French quarter - walled colonial villas in wide tree-lined
boulevards - was seen from the comfort of the car en route to the
Temple of Literature, an 11th century centre of learning where Mr
Hieu pointed out the faint etchings on stone tablets that list each
year's three most outstanding scholars.

We were plunged from this scene of erudition into living Hanoi a
few minutes later, as we eased ourselves in cyclos and bumped and
swerved our way around the Water Tower, past half-hidden pagodas
and through the 36 narrow streets that make up the old quarter -
Silk Street, Herb Street, Steel Street and Flower Street.

Silk Street is the heart of Hanoi's tourist district and, according
to Mr Hieu, the owners of the yellow and green shophouses are
prosperous enough to own a second family home in other areas of
Hanoi where space and water are in better supply.

Beyond Silk Street, however, and we were passing family rattan
factories and wizened old women with blackened teeth selling
obscure cigarettes for a few cents each.

Proprietors here have not fared as well. Life is traditional,
fascinating and raw. This part of Hanoi will not live out economic
reforms.

This tour was arranged by Vietnamtourism Ho Chi Minh City, tel:
(844) 826-4154. Similar tours are available on request from most
tourism companies. Scheduled tours can be picked up at the city's
backpacker cafes.

A DESTINATION WITH AUTHENTICITY

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

AGAINST a spectacular backdrop of silver-scarred mountains and
descending fog, a group of foreign tourists sit in a wooden hut.
They are offered bitter tea by a barefoot hostess clad in
embroidered scarlet, huge silver earrings hanging from her ear
lobes.

She belongs to one of the 60-odd ethnic minority groups based in
Vietnam's central highlands and mountainous north. Closely linked
to the Thai hilltribes, some of these groups have lived in Vietnam
for hundreds of years, others for thousands.

Virtually all retain a traditional lifestyle yet to be eased by
such conveniences as electricity and potable tap water.

The foreign tourists, meanwhile, form part of a growing group of
not-so-young visitors to Vietnam, willing to trek considerable
distances from base camps at places such as Sapa, Hoa Binh or Mai
Chau and to temporarily forego modern comforts for the chance to
get firsthand experience of the ethnic minority lifestyle before
the area becomes over-trekked.

Saigontourist, Ben Thanh Tourist, Vietnamtourism Ho Chi Minh City
and other leading tour operators offer trips around central or
northern Vietnam which include between two and five days of walking
and one or two overnight stays in ethnic villages.

While such tours are not a priority on the Vietnam National
Administration of Tourism's (VNAT) agenda, they nonetheless fit in
nicely with the image the NTO is trying to promote - as a rich
cultural destination.

"Cultural tourism" is the buzzword in industry circles and although
definitions are understandably soft, it is perceived as
educational, relatively environmentally friendly, and non-intrusive
for the host country.

More importantly, it addresses growing concerns shared by other
emerging destinations about the possible loss of Vietnam's cultural
identity in the face of increasing numbers of foreign visitors
touring more diverse destinations.

Explained Mr Do Quang Trung, chairman of the VNAT: "We are trying
to preserve our cultural and ecological environment and at the same
time promote tourism, which is a difficult task.

"I think we need to focus more on introducing our culture to
foreign visitors for this."

The idea of cultural tourism is not new and Vietnamese tour
operators are fired up by the idea of boosting cultural interest.

Said Mr Nguyen Van Nhi, general director of Vietnamtourism Ho Chi
Minh City: "We need to learn from other countries on how to
preserve the unique features of our country.

"We also need to create a more interesting product for tourists,
take them into the rural countryside, fruit gardens and pottery
villages.

"Or maybe take them into small family homes so they can see what a
family altar is like, rather than just be told.

"Basically we need to increase the cultural interest of tours in
Vietnam, not just in obvious ways.

"Culture influences so much, down to the way we arrange our
belongings in our houses. We need to create a specifically
Vietnamese product that is to do with history and culture.

"I believe that this is what people really want.

"Vietnamese, for example, are very interested in American culture,
and I am sure it works the other way too."

The new emphasis on culture - both popular and refined - is making
its way into tour programmes with Saigontourist now incorporating
farm visits in its Mekong Delta tours.

Conservationists in the former imperial capital of Hue are planning
authentic arts performances in the former Royal Theatre when
restoration work is finished next year.

It is also matched by a national enthusiasm for architectural
conservation that is applauded by most but has caused havoc for
developers in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City.

Sadly, few believe such enthusiasm is enough.

HONG KONG: CRUISE POTENTIAL HAMPERED BY FACILITIES

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

AMAGINE a Hong Kong-based tour operator offering two- to three-
night cruises into southern China, passing through old villages,
visiting ethnic communities and historic sights, and seeing the new
houses of rich Chinese who have returned after making money in
Hawaii.

After the cruise, passengers would have the option of a train
connection across the Thai border and down all the way into
Malaysia.

Or, with the generating interest in eco-tourism, take a cruise to a
stalagmite colony in coral under the waters near Sai Kung and west
of Tun Mun.

These are potential new cruise opportunities which 26-year tourism
industry veteran, Mr Edmund Tsang, sees as future possibilities for
Hong Kong's cruise tour industry.

Mr Tsang, who joined Watertours of Hong Kong in January this year
as general manager, is deputy chairman of the Travel Industry
Council of Hong Kong. While he has an interest in promoting the
products of his own company, he has a broad perspective on the
cruise industry, having served on the boards of a string of travel
trade associations.

Watertours of Hong Kong, the largest of the local cruise tour
operators, handled about 130,000 passengers last year. Mr Tsang
predicts a modest 15 to 20 per cent increase in the business in the
next few years, but growth, he believes, will be contingent on the
government's willingness to improve and increase the number of
berthing facilities.

"Right now, part of the harbour is a bit discouraging because of
the choppy waters caused by high-speed water traffic," he said.

"There is no real concern by the government for those who love
boating.

"With many people trying to board private and corporate vessels at
the same time, the tour operators are loading at Queen's pier and
the Kowloon public pier.

"The situation is jammed."

The Hong Kong Tourist Association (HKTA) among others, is
advocating that a new international passenger terminal be built,
perhaps at the present Kai Tak site.

Mr Tsang would like to see this also used as a boarding place for
local boating.

He has recommended to the government that other new boarding areas
for pleasure junks and tour operators be located in different parts
of Hong Kong, closer to where people live, such as at Tun Mun or
Kwun Tong.

His interest is not just in the overseas market, but also local
residents, partly because the expanding market of visitors from
China rely on Hong Kong relatives to guide and accompany them on
local sight-seeing tours.

Boarding points have to be conveniently located, and tours suitably
priced and promoted, for local people to think of taking their
China relatives on a trip.

Mr Tsang wants to see tours such as those to Lei Yue Mun and Lamma
Island marketed to Asian visitors not only as a seafood-eating
opportunity, but also as a chance to worship at the old temples in
the area.

On Lamma, he sees there are opportunities for Chinese and other
visitors to have a drink in the bars with the established
expatriate community, to talk to them and find out why they enjoy
the simpler style of life they have chosen in Hong Kong.

Mr Tsang notes that the water cruise business has adapted over the
years to accommodate the different interests of tourists as the
market changes and grows more sophisticated.

"In recent years, Asians have dominated the market. Many,
especially young Asians, are western-educated and are interested in
the cultural and historical side of Hong Kong.

"They are interested in seeing Po Lin Monastery on Lantau.

"The elderly don't tend to have this interest. They want to
concentrate on shopping.

"But younger Japanese, Malaysians and Singaporeans in particular
want to do what the European tourists do.

"They are likely to have afternoon tea at the Peninsula and travel
on the same boat as Europeans."

HONG KONG: THEME PARK IDEA TAKING OFF

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

THE Hong Kong Tourist Association (HKTA) has given a working title
to its plans to host a massive fair at the end of the century on
the runway at Kai Tak airport.

  Mr Mason Hung, the senior manager for product development at the
HKTA, said there would be so many millennium fairs around the world
that it had been provisionally decided to call Hong Kong's event an
exposition to set it apart from the rest.

  Plans for the Hong Kong Exposition are now being put to a
feasibility test, but could include a major business and trade
event.

  There could also be a permanent theme park on the huge site,
which will become available once the airport is relocated to Chek
Lap Kok in 1998.

HONG KONG: GOING TO WATER FOR HANDOVER

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

AFTER 150 years of British rule, Hong Kong returns to China on June
30 next year. Inbound tourist operators are advising clients not to
visit during the week of the handover - unless they have a special
interest in politics and already have accommodation confirmed.

Plans for the official change of sovereignty ceremony on June 30
and the celebrations on July 1 are expected to be announced at the
end of September. But a mascot for the celebrations has already
been chosen. The Preparatory Committee - the body appointed by
China to prepare for the new Special Administrative Region - has
selected the dolphin as the celebration mascot.

The dolphin may seem a strange choice, considering Hong Kong is not
usually associated with these animals.

However, a rare white (or pink) dolphin (sousa chinensis) is native
to Hong Kong, it can still be seen in the waters north of Lantau
Island, in the same area where the new Chek Lap Kok airport is
being built.

If there is irony in choosing an endangered animal as the handover
mascot, the Preparatory Committee seems to have missed it.

Seeing Hong Kong's dolphins in the wild is the latest tourist
attraction being marketed to international visitors by the Hong
Kong Tourist Association (HKTA). Two cruises are available,
organised by Hong Kong Dolphinwatch, a small, independent eco-
tourism operation.

Another new special interest cruise, the New Airport Tour, has been
developed by the HKTA for aviation enthusiasts and those interested
in the massive new airport construction.

The tour takes passengers into roughly the same waters as Hong Kong
Dolphinwatch, passing under the nearly completed Tsing Ma Bridge
and around to the north side of Lantau.

A land section of the tour visits the old Kowloon Walled City site,
now a park, where jets can be seen flying low over the tops of
buildings, then to Lung Cheung Lookout where aircraft are viewed
landing and taking off from the Kai Tak runway.

Before boarding the boat, tourists are taken to the Chek Lap Kok
Airport Core Programme Exhibition Centre.

Watertours of Hong Kong is among those operators which will
organise the New Airport Tour on request for special groups.

Other new or improved water tours have added to Hong Kong's cruise
options.

While visitors can still enjoy Pearl of the Orient harbour cruises
by day or night, they can now spend more time exploring the 235
islands which surround Hong Kong.

Lantau Island is particularly favoured by the tour operators,
partly because it is a tranquil green contrast to Hong Kong, but
mainly because of the popularity of the Giant Buddha at Po Lin
Monastery and Tai O fishing village.

Both Watertours and HYFCO Travel Agency offer cruises to Lantau,
but Watertours has recently extended its Lantau trip to give people
the option of an overnight stay on the island.

Mr Edmund Tsang, general manager of Watertours, says that in the
past people visiting Lantau and Cheung Chau have asked to spend
more time looking around the island.

To meet the demand, he has modified two cruises. The Cheung Chau
Island Hopping Tour now enables passengers to spend 90 minutes
visiting the beach and historic sites on Cheung Chau, as compared
with just 40 minutes in the past, and gives people the option to
hop across to Lantau Island

On the "Romantic Lantau" trip, tourists can elect to stay a night
at Lantau's Silvermine Bay Hotel or hop across to Cheung Chau
Island.

Watertours also offers tailor-made cruises for groups. These
include trips to Lamma Island for hiking and a seafood dinner,
treasure hunt expeditions to the old pirate haunt on Cheung Chau,
and tours which couple inspections of the new airport
infrastructure with archaeological sites.

The cost of the New Airport Tour depends on group size and
itinerary. Watertours' Cheung Chau Island trip (without the Lantau
add on) is HK$310 (US$40).

The Lantau tour, without an overnight stay is HK$465 for adults,
including lunch. With an overnight stay, prices start at HK$850.

Visitors who prefer a little adventure and independence can
formulate their own itinerary and visit the islands for a fraction
of the organised tour prices.

HONG KONG: NEW PARK PLANS CONSIDERED

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

AN exhibition and observation centre is being planned as a possible
addition to a new theme park in Hong Kong.

Ma Wan island is the site proposed for a theme park presenting the
history of Hong Kong and a south China fishing village. The island
is likely to be selected as the locale for a "film city" project
intended to be an Asian Universal Studios.

Ma Wan island is the location of one end of the Tsing Ma Bridge,
the world's longest suspension bridge built as part of the traffic
infrastructure for the new airport.

The Hong Kong Tourist Association is embarking on feasibility
studies and is in discussion with the Hong Kong government about
the various plans.

An option is to incorporate a site at Wok Tai Wan, providing an
observation point for one of Hong Kong's newest landmarks.

Meanwhile, Pearl of the Orient has two new destinations combining
Lantau Island and Tsing Ma Bridge. From Victoria Harbour, visitors
can visit the Po Lin Monastery and the Buddha on Lantau Island.

The Tsing Ma Bridge is the major sightseeing point during the trip.

HONG KONG: A BACK-FLIP ON ECO-TOURISM

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

IT is an extraordinary sight. On the edge of the dusty, flattened
tract of reclaimed land soon to become Hong Kong's new airport
runway, eight or nine curious dolphins surfaced by our boat.

Children and adults alike, poised with binoculars and cameras said
in chorus: "Wah! There they are again!"

I saw a six-year-old boy look at his father and exclaim: "It's even
better than the fireworks at Chinese New Year".

Environmentalist Mr Bill Leverett has been taking Hong Kong
residents on cruises around the north of Lantau island to see the
dolphins since March 1995. Only recently, with the help of the Hong
Kong Tourist Association (HKTA), has he begun marketing his tours
to international visitors.

"I wanted to raise awareness of the plight of the pink dolphins,
give them an economic value by helping them contribute to the
tourist economy, and generate revenue for research and campaigns,"
he said.

Hong Kong Dolphinwatch is one of the territory's few attempts at
eco-tourism. Passengers learn about the dolphin, how they are
endangered, and what can be done to help protect the marine
environment.

I was astonished that, while the dolphins are threatened by loss of
food, overfishing, pollution and boat traffic, Hong Kong
Dolphinwatch has about a 98 per cent success rate in sighting some
of the 80 to 200 dolphins which live in the area,

In less than 18 months, Hong Kong Dolphinwatch has taken about
3,500 people on dolphin-spotting trips.

There are two versions of the tour.

The one I took runs on Wednesdays, beginning with a 10.00 pick-up
at Queen's Pier, Central, and by the Star Ferry Pier in Tsim Sha
Tsui.

The comfortable pleasure cruise motored across the harbour under
the new Tsing Ma suspension bridge, then meandered slowly through
the waters near Chek Lap Kok on the lookout for the dolphins.

We sighted our first dolphin within a couple of hours of leaving
Central. We saw them in twos and threes at regular intervals, some
bone porcelain white, others a pinky colour.

After a large hot buffet lunch served on board, the boat was
surrounded by eight or nine dolphins.

On Sundays, the trip gives passengers more time near the dolphins,
with less time on the boat.

The weekend takes passengers from Tsim Sha Tsui by coach to Tuen
Mun, where a larger boat waits. Lunch is served at Tai O, the old
fishing village and tourist attraction on the north shore of
Lantau.

The tour costs HK$400 (US$52) per adult and HK$200 for children.

Mr Leverett contributes 10 per cent of proceeds from his cruises to
Hong Kong's Friends of the Earth Water Action Group.

Hong Kong Dolphinwatch also sells dolphin-related merchandise such
as tee-shirts, postcards and books.

Hong Kong Dolphinwatch can be contacted at tel: (852) 2984-1414,
fax: 2984-7799 and it can also be E-Mail: at dolphins@hk.super.net.

DEVELOPMENT PUSH FOR LANTAU

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

THE first thing most visitors to Hong Kong see as their aircraft
swings over the new Chek Lap Kok airport development is the Giant
Buddha on Lantau Island.

Most see no more of the Buddha or Lantau, but those who take the
time to explore this island and stay longer than the standard
organised day tour are generally rewarded with an experience of
Hong Kong beyond the cliches of tourist brochures.

Lantau is twice the size of Hong Kong Island. At present, only
eight per cent of all visitors to Hong Kong - and 18 per cent of
visitors from mainland China (now Hong Kong's largest and fastest
growing visitor market) - take a trip to Lantau. Most of these
visitors see little more than the Giant Buddha at Po Lin Monastery
and Tai O fishing village.

The Hong Kong Tourist Association's (HKTA) major Visitor and
Tourism Study (Vistour), which outlines the NTO's strategies for
the future of tourism in the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region, recommends the south-west part of Lantau be officially
classified as "Leisure Island".

The study recognises the appeal of the island's mountain scenery,
attractive coastal areas and its open environment. It also notes
that accessibility to Lantau is about to be radically altered by
the creation of new infrastructure serving the airport on its north
side which will link the island by rail and road to Kowloon and
Hong Kong.

Fortunately for Lantau, and the quality of life of Hong Kong
residents who enjoy the island on weekends, the HKTA does not
recommend all out tourist development. It recognises that there is
a fine line between giving the greatest number of people access to
the island and retaining the tranquil, green environment which is
central to the island's appeal.

Plans for the island include a cable car link between the township
of Tung Chung - formerly a small, remote fishing village on the
north side of the island which has grown in the past couple of
years into a thriving settlement servicing the airport construction
teams - to Ngong Ping (Lantau Peak).

 The project, which would be relatively inoffensive to the natural
environment, would enable easier access to the Giant Buddha and the
surrounding country park trails.

The government says it will not develop the present one-lane road
connecting Tung Chung with the southern part of the island.

The HKTA notes the increased number of people likely to use
Lantau's country parks and landscape protection areas would need to
be monitored.

"Any new development would need to be very carefully considered and
sited," the Vistour study said.

Nonetheless, the HKTA does propose a resort-style hotel near Po Lin
Monastery, possibly in conjunction with a golf course at Tung
Chung.

It is worth discovering Lantau Island, with its ancient forts, old
fishing villages and serene hillsides before the new airport is
completed (due in the first half of 1998) and whatever changes are
due to take place - well thought out or accidental, good or bad -
alter the character of the island and bring it into the 21st
century.

HIGH AIRPORT INVESTMENT

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

HONG KONG - Asia/Pacific hubs face radical change as extended-range
twinjets allow point-to-point flights to overfly traditional
transfer points, according to a leading regional aviation boss.

Mr John Mok, head of strategic planning for the Airport Authority
of Hong Kong, has predicted "the Asia/Pacific region alone will
need up to US$200 billion in airport infrastructure investment by
2010 to keep pace with traffic growth".

He said high capital costs in Asia/Pacific are a function of high
demand forecasts - 400 million passengers over the next 15 years,
more than half the world's total.

"Asia/Pacific is investing more in the development of its aviation
infrastructure than any other region in the world today," he said.

"However, it is in Asia/ Pacific where the competition for funds to
build a broad spectrum of infrastructure...is also the greatest.

"The potential risk of inadequate funding for airport development
will only grow in the future."

DE LIMA TO CLOSE

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

LANGKAWI - De Lima Resort, the island's largest resort, will cease
operations on September 15.

A short statement by its owner, Accruvest Hotel Management, said
that the resort would be closed for "major renovation" and that
future plans were being drawn up.

De Lima Resort, envisioned to be Langkawi's "most affordable
holiday hideaway" comprising 1,500 rooms, is operating only 100
rooms.

Standard and superior rooms have been priced between RM60.50
(US$24) and RM110.

TTG Asia understands that the resort will be closed for more than a
year in view of the extensive renovation works.

In its place will be a four-star hotel based on a Japanese concept.

There are plans to either rebuild or upgrade the chalets and
bungalows, which were built in a record 53 days during phase one of
development in 1992.

Mr Peter Mueller, chief executive officer of Kuala Lumpur-based
Granite Hotels & Resorts (GHR) which manages De Lima Resort, said
the 430 staff would be "terminated" and not retrenched as reported
by some media.

They include Mr Mohanadas Kumaran and Mr Ibrahim Nordin, who were
recently appointed general manager and resident manager
respectively.

Mr Mueller does not foresee any problems relocating the staff to
other hotels, particularly in Langkawi, in view of tight labour
problem that is affecting the whole country.

As for tour agencies such as Sala Tours & Travel Agency who have
made bookings earlier with De Lima Resort and prepaid them, these
bookings will be upgraded to the five-star sister property
Langasuka Resort's (LR) deluxe rooms and above.

A deluxe room at LR costs RM165.

HOTELS FEAR PHONE SURCHARGE CUT

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

By Virginia Saunders

JAKARTA - Hoteliers fear telephone surcharges are to be cut to keep
pace with Singapore's move to lower telecommunications charges.

Surcharges in Singapore hotels will be cut to S$0.30 (US$0.21) for
each direct call or fax to Malaysia from January. Current
surcharges in Indonesia range from 25 to 50 per cent

Concern has been heightened after a ministerial decree increased
rates on international long distance telephone calls from Batam to
Singapore.

The new Indonesian rate from September 1 increased Batam to
Singapore calls to Rp1,300 a minute (US$0.52) from Rp1,000. Outside
Batam, the calling rate to Singapore from any point in Indonesia is
Rp2,600 per minute. Calls from Singapore to Batam are S$0.50 per
minute, and S$1.80 per minute to other points in Indonesia.

The new rate and the current surcharges make calls from Indonesian
hotels one of the most expensive within the ASEAN region. Although
there are discounted hours, the state-owned domestic
telecommunications provider, PT Telkom, has changed the period when
50 and 75 per cent discounts apply on long distance calls.

Telkom offers 50 per cent discount on long distance calls between
18.00 and 21.00.

Discounted calls of 75 per cent have been moved from 21.00-06.00 to
23.00-08.00. Hotel surcharges are 25 per cent to 50 per cent more
than the normal rate for long distance calls.

PT Telkom said the decision to change was caused by a strong demand
for long distance calls after 21.00, which has "surpassed the
capacity of Telkom network facilities".

Long distance calls from 06.00-09.00 and from 15.00-18.00 are
subject to normal tariffs.

In 1994, Casa Grande, a group of Jakarta hoteliers, was able to
defer a plan by the ministry of telecommunications to regulate
surcharges on phone calls at a lower rate than that imposed by
hotels.

Most Jakarta hotels levy a surcharge of 45 to 50 per cent while
other provinces, including Bali, add 25 per to all hotel calls.

Jakarta hoteliers said they have not received any complaints from
guests over the surcharges. However, with the increase in telephone
rates and with surcharges being arbitrary, hoteliers are concerned
that they may be asked to reduce their surcharges to make doing
business in Indonesia more competitive.

One hotelier told TTG Asia calls from Singapore have been reduced
to a bare minimum "because they feel it will attract the MICE
market, now that there is a decline in tourist arrivals to
Singapore".

IBM is also planning to incorporate its NEDS Electronic Expense
Report solution with SABRE BTS. IBM expects to capitalise on the
travel and credit card data contained within the SABRE BTS system
to further simplify the expense reporting process for corporate
travellers.

INTER-CONTINENTAL GOES ON-LINE

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

ON-LINE bookings for Inter-Continental Hotels and Resorts worldwide
can now be made via the chain's site on Travel Web.

But, Inter-Continental says, this will not replace travel agents.

"Introducing on-line reservations via Travel Web shows we see the
Internet as significant technology for the 21st century, but it
does not mean we will see our travel agents as any less important,"
said Mr Michael Stajdel, senior vice-president of marketing and
strategic planning, Inter-Continental Hotels and Resorts.

"Travel agents will now be able to have a one-stop shop from (our)
site. (They can) book a hotel, check airline schedules, offer ideas
of what to do in the destination, check the latest weather, and
print their clients a copy to take away."

NEW CYBERNOMICS THREAT TO TRAVEL AGENTS

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

CYBERNOMICS - the convergence of technical and economic
undercurrents - is changing the way the travel industry does
business and, in the process, threatening the livelihood of travel
agents," cautions Mr Chris Lyle, chief of the economics and
statistics branch of the International Civil Aviation Organisation
(ICAO).

The costs to air carriers of using a CRS as a distribution channel
have come into the limelight recently. Cost levels are increasing,
and new forms of charges such as cancellation fees have arisen.

"Due to the economic undercurrents, airlines, hotels and other
travel service companies will choose to have fewer travel agents,
pay less commissions and move towards greater direct sales through
various automation options.

"Technology is increasing the capability for leaving the travel
agent - and even the CRS - out of the distribution chain entirely,"
Mr Lyle said.

For example, the method of selling airline tickets - through a CRS
or on-line service - is changing.

Airlines such as Lufthansa - which is using CD-ROMs - and Alitalia,
British Airways/ USAir, Continental, Delta, Northwest, Swissair and
United - which use diskettes - are either giving access to a CRS
via an airline server or direct access to the airline's individual
reservation system.

On the hotel side, Hilton is now distributing CD-ROMs to facilitate
Internet booking.

"Next, you have the recent substantive entrances into marketing
through World Wide Web sites on the Internet, as well as by many
other travel services.

"Currently, more than 100 major airlines from 62 countries have Web
sites. Further, US-based airlines have responded to the economic
undercurrents by placing a commission cap on domestic fares," said
Mr Lyle.

"After considerable initial fuss, the concept now seems to have
taken a firm foothold in the US. The first year of the cap is
reported to have produced an improvement in the bottom line of US
airlines to the tune of about US$400 million, no significant change
in market share between airlines imposing the cap and other
airlines, and a significant but not earth-shattering increase in
the number of closings of travel agents."

Not surprisingly, therefore, airlines outside the US are
considering similar action. More than one European airline is
reducing overrides and incentive payments.

Lufthansa has already announced it will be reducing basic levels of
commission where electronic ticketing is concerned. SAS has
effectively reduced commission via the SAS Travel Plan, a form of
electronic season pass, and start-up carrier EasyJet in Europe
appears to be taking the ValuJet approach to commissions, that is,
avoiding them if possible.

Another quirk in the commission structure is that at least one
airline in the US is now offering a bigger commission for booking
outside a CRS than when using a CRS.

While the CRS will stay in a focal role for some time, Mr Lyle
believes there will be a greater use of other travel distribution
channels that are now becoming available along with greater
interaction amongst these channels.

"One particular benefit of the evolution of new distribution
channels, notably the Internet, has been to sharpen the competitive
edge of the incumbents and the CRS."

Are we seeing the beginning of the end of the travel agent? Mr Lyle
thinks this seems unlikely.

"First, travel agents provide a much broader and often much more
personalised service to passengers than the airlines do directly.

"They are not tied to an individual supplier and offer expert (and
hopefully impartial) advice on different carriers, fares and
routings, different hotels and different car hire companies, just
to name a few products, and agents can themselves offer benefits.
For example, a franchising chain already has a frequent traveller
award programme.

"Second, sonic travel agency chains have major purchasing power and
are able to negotiate private fares with the airlines, passing on
at least some of the savings to their clients.

"They are acting as consolidators as well as agents. Thus, there is
no reason why a travel agent cannot make greater use of the
Internet to serve these clients."

Consequently, while there is likely to be some sort of shake-out,
coupled with more intensive consolidation into consortia or
franchising networks, travel agents appear to be here to stay
because of the value-added services they provide.

"However, the surviving agent will be aggressively automated, in a
niche market or part of a chain, and, most importantly, client
driven," said Mr Lyle.

NEW LIFE TO EVENT WHICH MAINTAINS ITS INTEGRITY

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

PATA's recent acquisition of VUSAMART, a three-day fair for North
American inbound traffic from September 9-12, gave new life to the
event's educational dimension but kept its original integrity of a
"business marketplace" intact, said show founder and PATA director
for the Americas, Mr Richard Valerio.

"When you have an organisation with one mind running it, mine,
there's always a limit," Mr Valerio told TTG Asia.

PATA broadens the event's educational scope and educates the
American market on Asia/Pacific trends before it is too late, he
said, citing a speech during the PATA marketing conference on the
growing economies and travel patterns of the Asia/Pacific.

"Now we have people who can deliver a real message, something
people can chew on," he said.

Mr Bill Hastings, PATA director-communications, added: "PATA brings
a global creditability, certainly a high level with Asians and
provides us with more opportunities (with companies) who have been
traditionally outbound operators in the Pacific Asia."

The reality is Asians like big cities, but new niche markets of
younger travellers are emerging, said Mr Valerio.

In October, he and PATA president and CEO, Mr Lakshman Ratnapala,
are meeting the Mexican minister of tourism to discuss ways to
develop infrastructure and marketing capabilities suited to the
Asia/Pacific region.

Travel to South America remains limited due in part to a lack of
air lift.

Mr Valerio has met industry leaders in Brazil, Argentina and Chile
to discuss ways forward.

MYSTERY OF ABSENT FRIENDS

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

Travel planners from Australia, New Zealand and India were not to
be found in the halls of the Walt Disney World Resort convention
hall at this year's 11th annual VUSAMART.

Australia and New Zealand, invited for the first time this year,
were not in participation possibly due to short notice.

Mr Richard Valerio, PATA director for the Americas, began talking
with their national carriers in January to assist him in
identifying qualified companies.

India's absence, on the other hand, remains a mystery.

In 1994, one Indian company attended, followed by an additional
three last year. This year, not one graced the theme park city of
Orlando.

"Why not here? I wish I had the answer. Hopefully the Indian press
will take 'em and shake 'em," said Mr Valerio.

He remained optimistic of the nation's potential as an inbound
market to North America. "The India market is certain to explode
and when they're ready, we'll be ready."

SPOTLIGHT ON USTTA OPTIONS

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

THE American government and private sector are looking at a number
of options following the demise of the United States Travel and
Tourism Association (USTTA), the country's national tourism
organisation, earlier this year.

One proposal is for a council along the lines of a privately-funded
NTO, said PATA director for the Americas, Mr Richard Valerio.

If approved, its establishment is still not expected for a further
two years.

PRAISE FOR TWO-WAY TOURISM

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

PATA officials defended the association's so-called "two-way
tourism" policy against criticism this year from those who
questioned whether it was an appropriate activity.

"Two-way tourism is an evolutionary process which some people have
been ignoring," said Mr Richard Valerio, PATA director for the
Americas.

"If we are suggesting to be a global society, you can't expect an
association to be isolated. The voice of the Pacific is not only
one-way."

Reaction to PATA's promotion of two-way tourism has been positive,
but some who have disagreed have spoken loudly and attracted
attention, said PATA director of communications, Mr Bill Hastings.

PATA's charter is to promote travel to and within Pacific Asia and
certainly the North America continent is within the PATA region, Mr
Hastings told TTG Asia, pulling out a PATA brochure with the North
American continent, including Canada, the US and Mexico clearly in
view.

"Unless we adjust to the change in the marketplace, we are not
providing the services we are here for."

ASIAN MARKETS POSE A CHALLENGE

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

North Americans at the PATA marketing conference on September 10
were told Asian markets are complex and the US faces competition
with attractive Asian destinations.

In his "Marketing Segmentation in Asia" presentation, Mr Brian
Deeson, president and CEO of Century International Hotels in Hong
Kong, selected five "lesser-known" Asian countries, including
India, Korea, Singapore, Thailand and Taiwan, to highlight as
examples of complexity.

He said: "Travel patterns are like ripples on a pond. People tend
to travel firstly within a very small radius from their own home
and then to increasingly remoter destinations as their
sophistication and spending capability increases.

"This means that by the time an Asian traveller hits North America,
he or she has probably already had several trips within Asia and
therefore, in relative terms, is quite a sophisticated traveller."

On India, a vast country frequently overlooked by its Asian
neighbours, Mr Deeson noted: "There are an estimated 300 million
Indians who could be classified as middleclass and thus have the
ability to travel outside the country as their lifestyles improve.
The market potential is therefore enormous."

Indian expenditure first goes to appliances, then cars and thirdly
travel, he said, adding that the greatest hindrance to increased
overseas travel has been a lack of international connections.

Mr Deeson was upbeat on "the recommencement of around-the-world
flights by United Airlines, taking in Delhi on a daily basis and
thus linking it to Europe and North America via Hong Kong".

On the Korean market, one of North America's most important in
Asia, Mr Deeson said overseas travel is fashionable and the desire
and means for such a leisure activity is spread throughout the
country.

Prospects for growth are good. The 1996 forecast for departures
varied from 4.2 to 4.5 million and double-digit growth per year
will be sustained until the year 2000.

Travel remains dominated by group tours.

"Korea is only what one operator termed 'flirting' with FIT
travel," he said.

Growth from Singapore, which on a per capita basis has the highest
number of travellers in the world, is expected to reach a plateau
by the turn of the century due to its small population. From 1991
to 1995, the number of visitors to the US grew marginally from
57,000 to 88,000.

"While the overall market will not grow, there are tremendous
opportunities for growing target niche-market segments," noted Mr
Deeson.

Thailand was also highlighted as "one of the more advanced
developing countries in Asia" with a population exceeding 60
million.

Thai traffic to the US doubled from 1991 at 47,000 to 94,000 last
year.

As for Taiwan, similar in some travel habits to Koreans and
Japanese, the over-50 crowd took a million trips abroad in 1994 and
are greatly influenced by what tour operators are featuring.

MIXED VIEWS OVER PULL-OUT

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

REACTIONS to the announced pull-out of the Canadian Tourism
Commission from PATA were mixed at the annual VUSAMART.

Mr Randy Ng, manager of Classic Holidays Tour & Travel of
Vancouver, said the decision will have a "spiritual effect" on the
Asian market.

"Before (Tourism Canada was a PATA member), people didn't think
Canada belonged to the Pacific Rim, but with PATA there's a sense
of belonging," Mr Ng told TTG Asia.

"Asians think Canada is cold, in the North Pole. But when with
PATA, they think it's part of the Pacific. It's easier to sell."

Representatives of two other Canadian-based travel companies
believed Tourism Canada paid so little attention to Asian markets
that the move will have virtually no impact.

"The influence will not be that crucial as far as the Asia/ Pacific
market is concerned because most Canadian operators have their own
connections and do their own sales trips," said Ms Cynthia Lau,
deputy general manager of TourLink Holidays, which focuses on the
Thai, Malaysian and Singaporean markets.

She said the national tourist office does not see Thailand and
Malaysia as potential markets, only as a surplus, "something like a
dessert".

Mr Raymond Chu, sales manager of Royal Canadian Travel of Ontario,
whose major market is Thailand, agreed: "Even though they pulled
out of PATA, we still sell to the Orient. We have our own
clientele.

"Those agents don't care if it's PATA or not PATA. As long as you
offer good service and good price, they give you business."

Last month, Tourism Canada announced the NTO was not renewing its
membership of PATA, citing a lack of sufficient benefits.

The organisation has a grace period until July 1, 1997, when
membership fees are due again.

THUMBS UP FOR PATA'S FIRST US FAIR

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

ASIA/Pacific travel buyers expressed general approval for PATA's
first attempt at running VUSAMART.

Mr Warren Ho, director of Ambience Holidays of Singapore, a GSA
operator and wholesaler, said the show was well-organised and
precise.

He said: "Not much time is wasted. We made a few good contacts and
renewed old contacts."

Of the new contacts, Mr Ho met mostly hotel chains and convention
bureaus which are not represented in Singapore.

"It is good to get feedback on how they are operating and it's good
for information gathering."

Ambience Holidays' primary focus is on the main gateways to the US.

Ms Rolland Cheng, a manager at Shangri-La Holidays Travel Lines of
San Francisco, said she had found new products.

As a ground handler of 50,000 to 60,000 people a year mainly from
Taiwan and a few South-east Asian countries, Ms Cheng said her
clients would be interested in Cancun in Mexico, and New Orleans.

"Normally, people stay on the west or east coast, so it's good to
know about these places," she said.

With little first-hand experience in New Orleans, she was
enthusiastic to learn about the casinos there.

Ms Cynthia Lim, senior outbound manager of Ho Wah Genting Travels
of Kuala Lumpur, said most of her previous groups have visited Los
Angeles, San Francisco and Las Vegas.

But after her first attendance at VUSAMART, she planned to also
promote Orlando and New York. While her clients to California have
seen Disney World and Universal Studios in action, Orlando also
offers Pleasure Island, an attraction she considered to be a hit
with her younger guests.

Although she had spoken with several hotels and ground agents, Ms
Lim was not looking for direct hotel contacts as she brought in
only two to three groups to the US per month and had a ground
handler to make all hotel arrangements.

She will be back next year to follow the trends.

Mr Kim Young-sun, president of The Korea Times Travel of Seoul,
said: "First I'm here to meet old friends, to exchange opinions and
to promote common interests."

Mr Kim was disappointed at not seeing everyone he had hoped would
attend the Orlando event.

CRUISE CALL TO THAILAND

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

BANGKOK - Thailand should develop its cruise industry and create
all-inclusive resort deals if it wants more of the US outbound
market, according to the US travel agents' top official.

American Society of Travel Agents (ASTA) president and CEO, Ms
Jeanne Epping, made these observations as ASTA prepared for its
World Congress in Bangkok from October 6-12.

She also noted that the biggest obstacle to overcome for Americans
travelling to Thailand is flight time and cost, although the
country offers some of the region's best prices.

Ms Epping told TTG Asia the Thai government needed "to develop its
cruise industry and encourage more ships to cruise its island and
look to all-inclusive resort pricing in special packages like those
offered by Hawaiian and Caribbean suppliers".

She added: "It should also offer more off-season pricing packages".

If all goes well during the World Congress, she predicted Thailand
could become Asia's top destination for Americans.

ASTA research claims previous host countries have experienced an
increase in arrivals between 10 and 40 per cent after hosting the
congress.

Last year, 328,000 Americans visited Thailand.

SINGAPOREANS GOING FOR ECO-TOURS

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

By Natalie Chen

SINGAPORE - More Singaporeans are opting for eco-adventure tours
with the market for such holidays ready to jump by 50-60 per cent
this year, said Mr Chang Theng Hwee, managing director of Country
Holidays Travel.

He estimated the niche market was still relatively small, making up
less than five per cent of the Singaporean outbound market.

But the Singaporean market for eco-adventure tours is the largest
in South-east Asia due to the population's environmental awareness.

"There are even less operators in this line which allows for our
growth in the local market," said Mr Chang.

Mr Benny Ng, assistant tour manager of Country Holidays Travel,
said the "hip to be green trend" has contributed to the popularity
of tours.

"Most of our clients like to know that their dollars are helping to
save the environment and the local indigenous population," he said.

Mr Chang said eco-adventure tours are a few hundred dollars more
expensive than standard packages.

Popular extras include visiting a private game park and having
meals prepared by their own cooks. The idea of exclusiveness and
hygiene appeal to consumers' tastes and they are prepared to pay
for quality.

Mr Ng said: "For eco-adventure tours, you can't be cheap because it
affects the quality and aim of such travel."

Mr Chang said a key reason for growth was that clients belonged to
the upmarket category.

"Even with the economic slowdown we are not affected because our
clients can afford the tours."

But he said the danger of eco-adventure tours lay in the abuse of
the term. He said: "Anyone can organise an 'eco-adventure' tour but
they may not carry out environmentally friendly practices."

He cited trekkers to the Himalayas, who used firewood instead of
kerosene, hence contributing to deforestation.

AUSTRALIA: SINGLE AIR MARKET GOAL

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

AUCKLAND - Air New Zealand's NZ$544 million (US$370 million) buy
into Ansett Australia will bring the proposed Australasian single
aviation market a step closer to reality, opening up new
opportunities for Asia's travel trade.

Air New Zealand chief executive, Mr Jim McCrea, assuming approval
from the Australian Foreign Investment Review Board and endorsement
by shareholders at a special meeting on September 27, said: "Once
this investment is made, the governments would then consider their
next step to harmonisation and rationalisation of the current
rules."

Over the past two years, the trans-Tasman aviation market has been
progressively deregulated, although wholly Australian-owned Ansett
New Zealand has been flying domestically in New Zealand since 1987.

Mr McCrea believes the next step is to allow any New Zealand or
Australian carrier to operate freely across the Tasman Sea and
within each other's countries.

"But it's up to the governments to negotiate that arrangement."

Mr McCrea said that as well as sharing in Ansett Australia's
domestic business, Air New Zealand could become involved in
international expansion through Ansett International, which already
flies to Hong Kong, Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, Korea and Taiwan.

He said: "I am delighted. It hasn't sunk in yet. Some of us have
spent...in excess of two years on this thing, every day of the
week.

"It's going to be very, very good for New Zealand and Australia.
It's going to be very, very good for Air New Zealand. And it's
going to be very, very good for Ansett."

It is looking at how it can integrate its fleet with Australian
domestic services and market them together.

ASIANS WOOED WITH OUTBACK DEAL

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

By Margie T Logarta

ADELAIDE - South Australia is hoping a unique cultural event will
put it on the tourism map in key Asian markets.

"Opera in the Outback" in the Flinders Ranges from September 18-21
next year may just lure Asians to venture into unknown territory.

The first concert, staged in 1988 to mark Australia's bicentennial,
attracted an audience of 9,300. The latest venture, featuring Dame
Kiri Te Kanawa, is expected to lure 12,500.

Some 2,000 seats have been reserved for international visitors.

The spectacle will be staged in Yalkarinha Gorge, whose magnificent
hills and towering gum trees provide a stunning backdrop.

Next year's presentation has been expanded to include a colourful
range of activities by surrounding communities, including train
rides on the historic Pichi Richi Railway in restored steam
locomotives, rodeos, country music concerts, sheep shearing, native
story-telling, bush tucker meals and open-air vintage theme parties
with live classical quartet.

The only Asians to have travelled through the South Australian
outback have been Japanese in rented cars or motorbikes on their
way to other states.

"They haven't been aware of what they can actually do," said Mr
David Tarr, chairperson, Flinders Ranges and Outback Tourism South
Australia.

He said Opera in the Outback gave Asians the ideal introduction to
an area millions of years old and teeming with incredible wildlife.
"They can see kangaroos, emus, eagles and reptiles while getting a
package which doesn't force them to go out of their safety zone."

Mr Scott Ireland, In Front Management director and ex-Singapore
resident, said although Singaporeans remained fascinated by Sydney
and the Gold Coast, a small but increasing number were realising
there was more to Australia than cities and beaches.

"If you were to combine an interesting cultural product, a bit of
wilderness, a bit of cold weather and lots of hands-on options,
then South Australia offers great potential," he said.

The Opera in the Outback packages start from A$360 (US$290) to
A$690.

LAOS' TRAGIC LOSS A LESSON FOR INDUSTRY

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

THE death of Claude Vincent serves as a grim reminder of the
potential pitfalls of travelling in the emerging tourism markets of
former Indochina.

A dangerous cocktail of war, weaponry and poverty in Laos
contributed to this senseless act of violence that cost Mr Vincent
his life. This is a scenario that has played itself all to often in
Cambodia, Vietnam, Myanmar and at times even Thailand.

We are often reminded that this can easily happen in New York or in
Europe, and cases of Asian visitors slain on trips to North America
are not unknown.

But that knowledge does little to soften the loss.

Few foreigners, in Laos, or in other countries in the region have
done more for their adopted country than Mr Vincent.

He was fond of saying that Laos was his country, his people, and he
worked with a passion that showed his commitment to his adopted
land.

After moving to Laos, he was one of only five or six expatriates
who stayed on after the liberation of Vientiane in 1975.

Having started a tour company in the early 1970s, he continued to
operate tours for visiting dignitaries heading to Vietnam until a
Vietnamese Embassy opened in 1977.

From 1977 untill 1989 he worked in trading coffee and in the
transportation industry, which opened his eyes to the beauty of
southern Laos, where several of Sodetour's lodges are located.

After returning to tourism with the Lao National Tourism Company in
1989, Mr Vincent started Sodetour in 1992, and the network of
lodges soon followed.

He was active in forming the Tourism Development Coalition in 1993
and was well know in the foreign community as a liaison between
Laotians and westerners.

This sad event should make the industry as a whole pause for
thought as operators rush into expanding markets. Concerns over
people's safety and security should never exceed the need to buy
and sell travel.

His passing also serves as a reminder of the dangers of tourism
expanding faster than the infrastructure and national development
in countries around the region.

LAO AVIATION STRUGGLES

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

VIENTIANE - Lao Aviation's new management team from joint-venture
partner China Yunnan Airlines is struggling to improve service and
bring the national carrier into the black one year after taking
over the reins.

Low load factors and local agents' expressed reluctance to sell the
airline leave several unanswered questions.

The Vientiane-Chiang Mai route is only running in the 30 per cent
range.

Nevertheless, Lao Aviation will still lease a second B737-200
(delivered on November 1) from the US and apply to fly to Hong
Kong, Macau, Kuala Lumpur and Singapore. Flights from Vietiane to
Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh and Phnom Penh will be added.

FEE BATTLE LOOMING

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

By Gina Putong

HONG KONG - Travel agents are hoping airlines will not resort to
raising air fares too high to buffer major increases in charges at
Chek Lap Kok airport.

Airlines and travel agents are waiting on the airport authority to
announce the cost structure for landing and other fees at Chek Lap
Kok.

P & O manager, Ms Irene Law, said she understood there should be a
premium for using a new airport such as Chek Lap Kok.

Ms Law said: "Although we have heard about the expected increased
rates for the new airport, it is still too early to say how much
airfares would be hiked. The question we ask is, to what extent?"

Mr Terence Wong, manager of Hong Thai Citizens Travel Services,
said travel agents would not worry about hiked rates.

He said air fares would not be able to climb too high as there
would be heightened competition as more airlines used the new
airport.

Another industry source believed that airlines had inherent
structures to provide leeway for such increases.

"Airlines will have to do cost-altering in other aspects of their
operations to balance off the increase so that it will not cause
air fare hikes which are too high," he said.

He believed that Hong Kong's airport would continue to be strategic
for airlines compared to neighbouring airports in China and Macau.

Various Asian airlines want to see at least some of the airport
authority's books before agreeing to pay higher charges for Chek
Lap Kok.

Orient Airlines Association, the major regional representative
airline body, warned of the detrimental effects the hiked rates
would have on airlines and travellers.

Mr Richard Stirland, director-general of the association, said the
news was "extremely disturbing for airlines and bad news for
travellers".

Mr Stirland expected a negative impact on tourism and trade to be
the result.

He said it was idle to assume airlines could simply absorb such an
increase without either passing it on to passengers through higher
fares or re-examining the economics of all services to Hong Kong.

AGENTS CAN WIN GAMES EXCLUSIVE

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

By Laura Lee

KUALA LUMPUR - Travel agents are being promised a share of the
action by the company which has been appointed to handle hotel
reservations for the Commonwealth Games in 1998.

Sukom Accommodation Bureau (SAB) '98, a specialised department set
up between organisers Sukom Ninety Eight and the UK-based Byrom
Consultants to organise lodging for visitors to the games, is not
designed to take away business from travel agencies.

Sukom Ninety Eight executive chairman, Gen (R) Tan Sri Hashim Mohd
Ali, told TTG Asia that SAB '98's role was a complementary one.

It would not have a monopoly over room bookings for the
Commonwealth Games as organisers want to avoid sky-high prices.

An estimated 6,000 rooms, ranging from dormitory-style to five-star
suites, have been selected from 44 hotels in Kuala Lumpur, Selangor
and Langkawi. Properties include: Hotel Istana; The Legend Hotel &
Apartments; Hotel Nikko; New World Hotel; Swiss Garden Hotel;
Renaissance Palm Garden; Sheraton Subang Hotel; Sunway Lagoon
Resort Hotel; Burau Bay Resort; and Radisson Tanjung Rhu.

Byrom Consultants event manager, Mr Jaime Byrom, praised Sukom
Ninety Eight for its early preparations.

He said: "We find Sukom Ninety Eight the most dynamic organising
committee that we have come across so far.

"We never had a brochure done two years before the event."

OPERATORS HAIL BEIJING'S DRIVE TO RAISE STANDARDS

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

HONG KONG - A nation-wide drive to monitor and remedy tourism
problems has got the thumbs up from China inbound travel agents
raring to see better business in the mainland.

Travel agents are lauding the National Tourism Administration's
service quality supervision system to promote standard service
within the country's tourism sector, which they say is gaining good
ground since its implementation this June.

"Efforts like these are going to bring in good business for us in
the long run," said Ms Eva Lai of Swire Travel.

Apart from getting less complaints from clients, she has noticed
that travellers are feeling more confident about going on a holiday
to the mainland.

But she said Chinese authorities should pay attention to details
when implementing measures.

Patterson Travel Service director, Mr Ling Kam Man, said that in
the past two years, service from travel agents and hotels has been
a lot better than before, especially with new five-star hotels
opening.

HAWAII EYES VISA WAIVER

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

SEOUL - The state of Hawaii is pushing hard for a visa waiver for
Korean tourists visiting the US.

"Hawaii is now working very hard on the issue of waiving visas for
Koreans," said Mr Kazumasa Tamura, vice-president of the Asia &
Pacific division of the Hawaii Visitors and Convention Bureau.
"There is strong official support in Hawaii among the governor and
senators."

Mr Tamura, who was in town for the Korean World Travel Fair
recently, said he expected the number of Koreans visiting Hawaii to
triple if visas were waived.

In 1995, 100,000 Koreans visited Hawaii.

However, Mr Paul Linneman, information officer at the US Embassy in
Seoul, said the law states clearly that a waiver can only be
considered if the rate of visa refusals for a country is less than
two per cent.

"Currently, between five and seven per cent of Korean applicants
are refused visas and this clearly falls outside the current
guidelines."

The US began the visa-waiver system in 1989 and among the first
beneficiaries were the UK and Japan.

HONG KONG: TRADE DOES NOT FEAR NET

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

By Gina Putong and Susie Zanardi

HONG KONG - Travel agents here are confident that direct airline
booking via the Internet will not threaten their livelihood.

"Although customers may book their tickets for simple travel plans
through the Internet, travel agents need not view this development
through wary eyes," said Mr Wyn Li, KLM sales and marketing manager
for China, Hong Kong and Macau.

"There will always be an important role for travel agents in the
scheme of things. The more complicated holiday plans will entail
different itineraries and flight schedules from various airports,
which customers don't have the patience for, even if the
information may be available to them," he said.

For such service, the customer will still turn to the travel agent.

Mr Li was commenting on a recent announcement by Dutch airline KLM
that limited ticket booking service for its flights would be
available via the Internet. Cathay Pacific Airways also said it was
keen to sell tickets on the Net within the next two years.

Mr Richard Willis, regional director and general manager of P&O
Travel, encouraged travel agents to embrace these technological
advancements as they would come fast and slick. "Most travellers
cannot handle the complex fare structures and won't really have
access to all the comparative airline fares and schedules," he
said.

Going on the Net, he said, would only serve to highlight the travel
agent's role as consultant and "custodian of the client".

"It would only be a threat if travel agents become complacent and
fail to face up to technology," said Mr Willis.

Ms Ridy Suen, leisure travel manager for Thomas Cook, said that the
Internet could be turned into an advantage for the agent. "On our
part, we have begun packaging holiday destinations - which include
air fare, accommodations and other services - and made them
available on our Web site and the response has been very good."

But Mr David Ho, managing director of Sime Travel in Singapore,
said: "Whether it is KLM or any other airline, the moment it
infiltrates into customer fares, it will affect agents. But those
who need other services will still go to agents."

Mr James Reinnoldt, Northwest regional managing director for South-
east Asia and Greater China, said: "In Internet sales, airlines
find the customers. The agent only issues the tickets. But for the
full range of service provided by agents, we will still pay the
full nine per cent."

JAKARTA RATES STILL FALLING

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

JAKARTA - Five-star Gran Melia's opening salvo of US$145 per night
could change the way the market looks at Jakarta hotels.

Now suffering from a high inventory of hotel rooms, with more to
open in 1997, Jakarta's hotel rates have been on a downward spin
for a few months, though some continue to maintain US$200 a night.

Hoteliers have been closely monitoring Gran Melia, which soft-
opened in July. Its opening rates have had an impact on hotels
within the "golden triangle" - the confluence of three major
avenues in Jakarta.

Some four-star hotels feared it could be disastrous for them if
Gran Melia opened with US$139 a night, while some five-star
properties said they would hurt if the opening rate was less than
US$169.

Gran Melia general manager, Mr Eberhard Linke, told TTG Asia: "We
must be realistic. We do not live in Utopia. We know the market and
what it can do".

Mr. Patrick Fiat, general manager of Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza, said
he is monitoring Gran Melia's pricing strategy.

"If they go down that will pull down everybody - Holiday Inn,
Mandarin, Hilton, and Regent," he said.

SINGAPORE: ATTRACTIONS DISTRACTIONS

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

By Margie T Logarta

SINGAPORE - Dwindling visitor numbers have prompted the Association
of Singapore Attractions (ASA) to organise a series of workshops to
educate members about the needs of inbound markets.

A survey by the Singapore Tourist Promotion Board (STPB), showed an
11.2 per cent decrease in entries to tourism attractions in 1994,
attributed to keen regional competition and shorter stays. In 1995,
the figure improved to only a 1.5 per cent drop due to rock-bottom
prices.

ASA chairman, Mr Francis Phun, said the seminars will prepare the
organisation for aggressive promotions.

He said: "We had some sales missions in the past but the results
were not fantastic. We are now in the process of taking stock of
ourselves so we will know how to reposition ourselves better."

Speakers will include chief executives of some of ASA's member
organisations and travel specialists who will share insights on
individual markets such as the Japanese, Korean and Taiwanese.

Mr Phun said tourism entrepreneurs cannot depend on the STPB for
survival.

"We have to stop being passive and bring in the business ourselves.
If we can bring the cake back to Singapore, then that is the time
we can share it."

The island's humid environment, he added, had also been identified
as a factor linked to the decrease in visitor patronage.

LUFTHANSA QUITTING NEPAL

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

By Neelam Mathews

KATHMANDU - Nepalese tour operators are blaming the government for
a slowdown in tourism growth following Lufthansa German Airlines'
decision to give notice to quit the kingdom.

Operators said despite Nepal proclaiming its Visit Nepal Year,
landing and parking charges in the first six months have been
increased by 50 per cent and fuel charges by 30 per cent.

With calls being made for a new airport, sources contend there is
nothing on the horizon. They do not expect swift action as the
present airport was built with 70-80 per cent foreign aid.

The travel trade says pollution and lack of planning is leading to
the decline of Nepal's tourism.

Lufthansa, the only European carrier flying directly to Kathmandu,
has explained why it is almost certain to withdraw from Nepal.

Low yields, the end of double digit tourism growth and difficulties
with the location of its international airport, are being cited as
main reasons.

Lufthansa flew more than 25,000 passengers last year into Nepal but
the airline's board is expected to decide for a stop in operations.

Following Lufthansa's directive to German tour operators that the
carrier will not accept bookings to Nepal after April next year, Mr
Kavin Sethi, corporate communications director Asia/Pacific, flew
to the country to inform the trade.

Mr Sethi said: "The board is reviewing the viability of the route
as part of an overall exercise to ensure permanent competitiveness
for the Lufthansa product."

The unique location of Kathmandu airport in a valley, with a 3,000m
runway instead of the conventional 4,000m, is being cited by
Lufthansa as a reason for a cut in profits.

Most aircraft flying into Kathmandu are twin-engined. To ensure
safety in case of engine failure during take-off, either passenger
or fuel load has to be reduced. Except for nearby-based Thai
Airways International, all carriers stop en-route to refuel.

Mr Sethi said: "This has led to additional costs as we require
three sets of crew as against two on a direct haul for the same
distance.

Lufthansa started operations in Nepal nine years ago. Since then,
its presence in the Himalayan kingdom has grown continuously.

To meet the growing travel and export demand in the Nepalese
market, Lufthansa has three weekly flights via Karachi to
Frankfurt.

"We have been the only western carrier to offer direct services to
Kathmandu.

"The others are all east-bound carriers."

NO MORE FLIGHTS

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

KATHMANDU - The Royal Nepal Airlines has cancelled its India and
Paris flights for an indefinite period because of a shortage of
aircraft.

For several days, the airline has run press advertisements telling
clients to contact travel agents without spelling out its impending
intentions.

The India sector is the most lucrative route for the carrier. RNA
flies twice daily to New Delhi and once weekly to Mumbai and
Calcutta.

The cancellation follows the expiration of a leased B-727 from
Aviogenex of Serbia. The contract had expired four months ago.

REBELS HURTING IRIAN TREKKING TOURS

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

By Virginia Saunders

JAKARTA - Tour operators offering mountain climbing packages in
Irian Jaya have seen business fall by at least 40 per cent this
year because of military operations against Irian Jaya rebels.

"We are all hurting," said Mr Chaksana Said, marketing manager of
Trekmate Outdoor Adventures.

"The hostage situation in Irian has been going on since January,
and a second abduction came in August right after the first one was
resolved. We have had to cancel all our tour packages and readjust
our plans for the whole year."

Members of the Free Papua Movement in January kidnapped 26 people,
including seven foreigners. In May, a military rescue operation saw
two Indonesian hostages killed before the others were rescued.

On August 14, an armed group seized 16 logging workers near the
south-eastern base of Cartensz peak.

Authorities have closed the glacier-covered Cartensz Pyramid, the
fifth highest peak in the world at 4,884m.

Trekmate, which was selling Irian Jaya to an international
adventure market, was enjoying brisk business before the crisis.

Mr Eka Agus Rachman, managing director, said: "The Cartensz Pyramid
is the main objective of these seasoned professional climbers. We
have tried offering other alternatives, but they won't climb any
other mountain in Indonesia. It is either Cartensz or nothing".

Expeditions to Cartensz start from US$1,900 per person. Trekmate is
looking at running more outward bound programmes and shifting to
soft adventure tours in Baliem Valley at the base of the peak.

Mr Said added that hard adventure programmes in Indonesia had
difficulties with travel insurance.

Trekmate does not know when Cartensz will reopen for trekking tours
and expeditions. Mr Said said it was up to the government.

INDIA: AGENTS SLAM IA FARE HIKE

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

By Neelam Mathews

NEW DELHI - Tour operators have condemned a 16.3 per cent fare rise
on domestic carrier Indian Airlines (IA) from September 22.

The rise will be in effect on all routes except in the north-
eastern sector, where the hike will be 10 per cent. According to
Indian Airlines, the US dollar fare will be revised with effect
from March 1.

Indian domestic traffic, of which 70 per cent is corporate, is not
likely to decline significantly but tour operators fear the leisure
market  will suffer a 15 per cent fall.

A Delhi-Mumbai one-way business class ticket will now cost US$176
instead of the previous US$151.  Economy goes up to US$118 against
US$101. Delhi to Madras by economy will be US$179 (formerly
US$154), and business class US$267 (US$230). Some fares can go up
by 15 to 30 per cent, depending on the sector.

"Indian tourism seems to be bent on stomping on its own feet," said
Ms Mili Sham, tour manager for Travel Inn.

"We're sending a crystal clear message to the world that we are
unreliable. What happens to my tours that have already been paid
and booked for the months between April to June 1997 based on IA's
present tariff?"

She said that her company now either faced law suits or absorbed
the cost which she claimed.

Mr Rajiv Wahie, Vacations Travels and Tours sales director, said
India was pricing itself out of the market. "IA had a 15 per cent
price hike in January this year...now comes another bombshell."

TOUR AGENTS KILLED IN LAOS

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

By Tom Racette

BANGKOK - Mr Claude Vincent, director of Vientiane-based Sodetour,
and three staff have been killed in an ambush on a newly-built
portion of highway 13 to Luang Prabang.

Sources in Vientiane said Mr Vincent was transporting a recently-
purchased minivan with six other staff members on September 12 to
the company's new provincial office in the northern city of Luang
Prabang.

In an apparent robbery, unknown assailants riddled the van with
bullets and made off with currency and valuables worth more than
US$9,000, said marketing manager of That Luang Tour, Mr Surith
Sengsavang.

A French resident of Laos for more than 30 years, Mr Vincent was a
tireless promoter of Lao tourism and had travelled extensively
around the country without incident.

Travelling by road from Vientiane to Luang Prabang is not
considered safe. Another assault outside the town of Kasi took
place eight months ago in the same spot where Mr Vincent was
killed, said Novotel Vientiane general manager, Mr Arnauld Kindt.

He expressed surprise that Mr Vincent had taken highway 13 to Luang
Prabang.

He said: "He always told me it's safe to travel anywhere in Laos,
but not there. Not by road."

Mr Kindt was among a number of South-east Asian trade professionals
ready to pay tribute to Mr Vincent, saying he was the first to
promote the country in foreign markets.

He continued: "He was the one to explain and promote the country to
European travel agents after Laos opened to tourism. His door was
always open to people who wanted advice on where to go and what to
see."

Tour operators told TTG Asia that only foreign backpackers on local
transport make the journey.

"Our company never sells programmes with land transfers to the
north. We receive requests from abroad but we always refuse.
Officially, it isn't allowed," said Diethelm Travel Laos managing
director, Ms Vayakone Bodhisane.

According to Mr Surith, the incident highlighted the risk of
overland transfers in a country which is just opening up to
tourism.

"The new road to Luang Prabang is still very dangerous. We can't
guarantee our clients' safety and something like this can still
happen anytime."

Mr Bounty Sayarath, product manager for Sodetour, said operations
would "continue as usual" for the immediate future.
