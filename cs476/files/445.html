Tyrone man targeted at Heathrow

BY MICK NAUGHTON

SINN Fein's Francie Molloy has exposed another British
undercover operation in London this week.

Molloy revealed that a young nationalist, from the
Coalisland area of east Tyrone has been hounded by British
agents, both at his home and workplace in Britain.

The man in his mid-20s, who did not wish to be named for
fear of losing his job, first became suspicious last May as
he returned to London from Tyrone where he had been
attending his grandmother's funeral. As he disembarked from
a flight two men, `Chris' and `John', struck up a
conversation with him about the problems of getting regular
work in London. Both had what sounded like polite Belfast
accents.

The Tyrone man, who works at Heathrow airport's Terminal 4
and who has lived in London for four years, thought nothing
more about the short encounter until he walked into his
local bar weeks later to find the pair drinking together.
They reminded him of their earlier discussion. After that
the pair appeared regularly in a number of other places and
on several occasions called to the man's home to get him out
for a drink. During conversation `Chris' and `John' told him
they were thinking about opening a bar and asked if he would
be interested in ``regular employment.'' They pressed him
repeatedly, promising `easier money.' The man's present job
entails him doing 12-hour shifts. He said he wasn't
interested.

However, at the beginning of this week, on Monday evening,
the pair's concentrated attention finally came to a head
when `Chris', (described as being of a heavy build) declared
they ``worked for the government and had access to huge sums
of money.''

The worried man, speaking by phone to this reporter from a
north London location on Tuesday morning, related what
happened next.

``After telling me this, they showed me a photograph clearly
taken at my workplace in the airport at 9.40am this Monday
morning. They showed me another photo of my brother's former
partner and they said they knew he had served time as a
republican POW and was now `working in England.' To be
totally honest, I was terrified, they knew so much about my
movements, who my girlfriend was (she comes originally from
Co Kildare), and information about my employer.

``I was so nervous at being alone with them that I agreed to
meet them at 6.40pm on Monday evening at a bar in Heathrow.
I was due to start my shift at 6.30pm so they clearly had
checked this week's shifts arrangements. Hailing a taxi they
said they would leave me home as they didn't want `something
terrible' to happen to me.

```Chris' then showed me an envelope full of bank notes, but
I refused to take it. As they got out of the taxi `Chris'
threw a =A320 note, laughing, saying they would `at least pay
the taxi for now'. I told the driver to head on and stopped
when they were out of sight. Even though the fare was only a
couple of pounds I gave the driver the =A320 and asked him for
a receipt, which he signed. I then took myself off, phoned
my employer and asked for a few days holiday. I am very
frightened.''

=46rancie Molloy called to the young man's father's house in
Tyrone that same night and talked with the British agent's
victim by phone, assuring him that he had notified human
rights lawyer, Gareth Peirce and an Irish-based lawyer
familiar with similar threats and approaches. Molloy has
also given him a contact number in London where he can be
reached during Molloy's visit to London this week.

``This is a disturbing case,'' explained Molloy. ``Over the
past number of weeks other victims have come forward but
requested no publicity. Worringly these approaches have
increased from the murder of Diarmuid O'Neill on 23
September. It is clearly a signal from MI5 and other covert
agencies that they are intent on targeting the Irish
community in England. What other shattered lives are they
leaving by these heavy-handed oppressive tactics? I would
appeal for anyone caught in a similar trap to contact a
lawyer, or public representative to document their
activities. Not to do so entails a life of manipulation and
misery at the hands of a government dismissive of people's
human rights.''

I remember that Dr. Kies had problems starting this list, for lots of

I hope that no 'subscription confirmers' had had that problem at that time,

The only thing that dim-witted comments such as the one above will accomplish
is that you will be placed on "nopost" as well as "nomail"; which means that
you've become a "non-person" as far as the list is concerned!

Once again: your names and addresses are secure because the whole list is
set to "review-by-owner", which means that no one can get your name! Try it
and test it!

Once again: Subscription confirmation is a mechanism by LISTSERV by which
the list is kept free from error addresses and bogus names...to some extent.

Once again: with my comments I simply tried to make sure that you don't miss
the subscription confirmation notice from listserv because LISTSERV will
delete your name if you don't confirm! AFTER YOU'VE BEEN NOTIFIED!
I intended this to be a service to you! Listserv will do this for all our
benefit every three months!

Once again: if you have questions, please contact ME - not the list.

Once again: if you post crap on this list, you'll do it only once!

My apologies to the vast majority of the list members that have to read and
deal with this sort of thing.

Does anybody have an idea concerning the historical origins of the Intelligence

Linkage that; 'the origins of the idea are not clear'.  I understand that it was
originally designed by the French but any information about an article book
concerning its origins would be gratefully received.

Not quite sure what you mean by "intelligence cycle".  But the oldest texts
making reference to Intelligence (spying) would be texts from Sun Tzu and
Wei Liao-Tzu, two chinese warfare strategests that ripped mystism from
chinese warfare strategy.

"Those unguarded in their communications can be clandestinly listed to."
--Wei Liao-Tzu

Something like the 3rd B.C.

I'll have to check.
