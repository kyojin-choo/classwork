Resource allocation, including manpower and other expenses, have
limited the evolution of minimally invasive surgical procedures
to provide humanism and to improve surgical care for patients.
Robotic enhancement has been proposed as a mechanism to improve
the cost-benefit relationship for patients. To this end, we have
used the robotic arm enhancement to minimize resource and personnel
utilization during minimally invasive procedures. Phase I of our
study has included the use of the robotic arm in 24 laparoscopic
hernia repairs, cholecystectomies, and nissen fundoplications
with the surgeon as a solo-surgeon, i.e., the primary surgeon
is the only participant in the operative sterile field. The scrub
nurse did not participate in the procedures. During this study,
there were no technical mishaps, no complications related to the
solo-surgeon - robotic arm concept, and the operative times were
statistically similar to equivalent procedures utilizing multiple
personnel. The hernia repair is least complex and most amenable
to solo-surgery due to the use of only three access ports; cholecystectomy
occasionally requires four access ports increasing its complexity
to a measurable degree. Nissen fundoplication, however, requires
five access ports and proved to be the most complex of the procedures
to adapt successfully to solo-surgery utilizing robotic arm enhancement.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Phase II of our study has involved the
use of a combination of technologically complex and sophisticated
technology to improve outcomes in complex laparoscopic procedures.
The Head-Mounted Display, AESOP, the robotic arm, and the Harmonic
Scalpel have been used in 140 complex minimally invasive procedures;
the procedures were laparoscopic spine surgery (24 cases), laparoscopic
gastric surgery (28 cases), and laparoscopic colon resection (88
cases). The use of these sophisticated technologies added safety,
improved versatility, and did not increase the length of the operative
procedures. The use of multiple technologies had an additive effect
on the benefits. There were no experiences in which the technologies
contributed to a technical complication or an adverse result for
the patients. However, the successful use of these technologies
requires an in-depth educational experience for the surgeon and
for the operating room team.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">In a further effort to improve efficiency
and control of the visual fields during minimally invasive surgery,
we have tested a new prototype voice activation and instrument
tracking control method for the robotic arm in order to create
a nearly seamless method to control the visual field. Prototype
voice activation and deactivation also allows instruments to be
used in the visual field for the surgical procedure while not
being used for tracking of the visual field. Tracking with the
instrument utilizing a color-coded tracking system has been 100%
effective in our hands, has not induced errors in technical performance
of procedures, and has shortened the time required for performance
of specific procedural tasks. Further, this process improves versatility
for the surgeon, increases concentration, reduces fatigue and
does not interfere with the position of the surgeon. Areas for
improvement which have been observed utilizing these techniques
are (1) the use of appropriate and consistent voice activation
terminology, and (2) the proper positioning of the instrument
tracking unit in the most appropriate locations on the video screen
and on the instrument within the visual field.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">We have concluded from these experiences
that the robotic technology will continue to reduce costs and
minimize risk for patients undergoing minimally invasive surgical
procedures; moreover, safety, versatility, and diminished use
of resources will accrue utilizing the additive benefit of sequential
sophisticated technologies requiring a simultaneous educational
investment in team development. Further, we conclude that with
further development that voice activation and instrument tracking
of robotically enhanced minimally invasive surgical procedures
will improve efficiency, effectiveness, and will diminish risk,
resource utilization and cost.</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=2>INTRODUCTION<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Surgical care of patients has heretofore enjoyed
improved quality of care and diminished risk to patients due to
continuous technological advancements and similar improvements
for the operating room environment. Improvement associated with
sophisticated technology has, however, historically been associated
with an increase in resource utilization (most often measured
by increased cost). The current medical economic environment,
however, tends to slow the progress elucidated by technology due
to the intense focus on minimizing cost and resource utilization
in the healthcare environment. As a result, new and evolving technology
carries a new burden; not only must the technology improve the
efficiency and productivity of the surgeon and simultaneously
decrease risk to the patient but it must also reduce cost and/or
resource utilization in order to be considered a viable product
for the current surgical operating theater.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In an attempt to address this issue, we have chosen
to use robotic arm enhancement as the key technology to reduce
cost in the operating theater while simultaneously diminishing
patient risk and improving productivity and quality of patient
care. The robotic arm is most often used in minimally invasive
surgery to hold the laparoscope and camera. It moves the visual
surgical field with precision under the direct control of the
surgeon<SUP>1</SUP>. Thus, one personnel resource (a physician's
assistant or assistant surgeon) is no longer required for the
operative procedure allowing the individual to provide health
care for other patients. Further, control of the visual field
by the surgeon diminishes the need for communication between personnel
and improves the focus and concentration of the surgeon. Moreover,
the robotic arm maintains the optical field stable and motionless
providing the surgeon with an environment for improved precision
and efficiency during the surgical task(s). A further benefit
of the stable, motionless image occurs in conjunction with the
use of the robotic arm and 3-D technology for minimally invasive
procedures. The motionless image improves the quality of the 3-D
image dramatically when compared to the hand-held 3-D image. Thus,
the cumulative benefit of two technologies enhances the visual
field with resultant improved quality and efficiency by the surgeon
as well as a concomitant diminution in the risk of error during
the procedural tasks. Other sophisticated technologies which synergistically
improve efficiency and thereby diminish risk as well as shorten
operating time (with a commensurate decrease in costs or operating
room utilization) include the Head-Mounted Display (HMD), the
Harmonic Scalpel, and the Zoom Camera Lens.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The HMD provides the surgeon with a relaxed position
and binocular vision thus further improving the stability of the
visual surgical image<SUP>2</SUP>. The HMD specifically allows
the surgeon to always work in a normal hand-eye axis thus avoiding
inefficient and dangerous paradoxic motion<SUP>3</SUP>. It also
enhances the benefits of 3-D technology with the addition of binocular
vision<SUP>4</SUP> providing a circumstance to further improve
efficiency and decrease risk thus improving outcome.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Harmonic Scalpel is a versatile laparoscopic
instrument which cuts, coagulates, acts as a retractor, grasper,
pointer, sharp dissector, and blunt dissector<SUP>5</SUP>. Its
use diminishes instrument exchanges and thereby increases the
focus of the surgeon, diminishes the need for intermittently changing
operative visual fields for instrument exchange, with resultant
cumulative benefits in the areas of efficiency, operative time,
patient risk, and ultimate resource utilization.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The zoom camera lens adds the opportunity for the
surgical operative field to be a fish-eye panoramic view versus
a very close detailed view being under the direct control of the
surgeon and changeable by the turn of a switch. This added versatility
in the size of the visual field adds a magnitude of versatility
to the use of the robotic arm.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The robotic arm technology currently is controlled
by the surgeon with a foot pedal. While the foot pedal provides
reasonable control by the surgeon, other foot pedals compete for
space and attention in the operating theater. Other forms of control
and activation of the robotic arm and subsequent control of the
visual field would seem to be beneficial.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>To address these issues, we have designed a three-part
study; the first is the performance of solo-surgeon procedures
(solo-surgery) using robotic enhancement<SUP>6</SUP> as the aid;
the second is the cumulative and synergistic benefits of multiple
sophisticated technologies (along with the robotic arm) to enhance
efficiency in complex minimally invasive procedures; and the third
phase is to investigate the use of prototype instrument tracking
and voice activation to control the robotic arm and subsequently
control the visual laparoscopic field of view.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=2>METHODS<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Phase I: We performed solo-surgeon surgery for 24
patients who were electively undergoing either laparoscopic hernia
repair, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, or laparoscopic nissen fundoplication.
In all cases, solo-surgery was defined as &quot;performance of
the operative procedure without the help of an assistant, a nurse,
or another surgeon.&quot; The scrub nurse did not help the surgeon
during the procedure. In all cases, the time of the operative
procedure, operative technical mishaps, and the number of occasions
that the laparoscope was removed from the abdomen to clean the
tip were recorded. The laparoscope was affixed to the robotic
arm in all cases and control of the robotic arm, the laparoscope,
and the subsequent optical surgical field of view were controlled
by the surgeon using a foot pedal control. These data were compared
to similar data collected from patients undergoing these three
minimally invasive procedures in circumstances in which robotic
arm enhancement was not used and the surgery was not performed
by solo-surgeon.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>During each of the laparoscopic solo-surgeon procedures,
a second surgeon or a Physician's Assistant was immediately available
to help the solo-surgeon in circumstances of necessity.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Phase II: To assess the cumulative benefits of the
robotic arm plus other sophisticated technologies in improving
efficiency during highly complex minimally invasive surgical procedures,
we utilized robotic arm enhancement plus a combination of HMD,
3-D Optics, the fish-eye Zoom Lens, the Harmonic Scalpel, and
the ergonomic sitting position during 140 elective procedures.
The procedural experiences were laparoscopic anterior spine surgery
(24 cases), laparoscopic gastric surgery (28 cases), and laparoscopic
colon resection (88 cases). The number of operative technical
mishaps, the category of the first assistant (surgeon vs. physician's
assistant), and the number of times the scope was removed to clean
the tip were recorded. These data were compared to comparable
data recorded for patients undergoing these procedures in the
absence of sophisticated technologies.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Phase III: The porcine model was used to study instrument
tracking and voice activation of the robotic arm in order to move
the operative field of view by the surgeon. For instrument tracking,
computer activation of a color sensor by a blue tape on the shaft
of the surgeon's instrument in the operative field was used. Once
the field of view was moved to a new location by the device tracking
the blue shaft on the surgeon's instrument, the tracking was de-activated.
Complex laparoscopic skills were performed including running the
bowel, suturing, tying, and dissecting adhesions using the instrument
tracking device. The ability or inability to move the visual field
appropriately during the performance of complex skills was recorded.
To determine the ability of voice activation to control the operative
field of view using the robotic arm, the surgeon imprinted the
following words on the voice activation device: &quot;in&quot;,
&quot;out&quot;, &quot;left&quot;, &quot;right&quot;, &quot;up&quot;,
&quot;down&quot;, &quot;stop&quot;. The use of each command activated
the robotic arm to move the visual field in the direction described
by the command. The command &quot;stop&quot; de-activated the
robot resulting in a stable motionless field of view. Complex
laparoscopic tasks were again used during activation and de-activation
using voice commands.<BR>

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=2>RESULTS<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Solo-Surgery: The 24 patients who underwent solo-surgery
using robotic arm enhancement and minimally invasive approach
all experienced successful completion of their operative procedures.
There were no incidents of technical mishap in any of the procedures.
The cholecystectomy procedures had an average operating time of
54 minutes compared to 61 minutes for other laparoscopic cholecystectomy
patients. The solo-surgery laparoscopic herniorrhaphy procedures
had an operative time of 76 minutes compared to 84 minutes for
non-solo surgeon laparoscopic herniorrhaphy procedures. The solo-surgery
laparoscopic nissen fundoplication procedures had an average operating
time of 112 minutes compared to an operating time of 160 minutes
for comparable non-solo surgery operative procedures. The number
of times the laparoscope required cleaning per 60-minute interval
for cases involving solo-surgery and the robotic arm were 1.4
compared to 9.1 per 60-minute interval for comparable cases when
the robotic arm was not used.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Complex Laparoscopic Procedures Using Cumulative
Sophisticated Technologies: Of the 140 patients undergoing complex
minimally invasive surgery utilizing a combination of robotic
arm enhancement, the Harmonic Scalpel, the Head-Mounted Display,
3-D technology, and the ergonomic sitting position all were successfully
completed utilizing the minimally invasive approach. There were
no technical mishaps either related or unrelated to the technologies.
Operating times were 155 minutes for gastric procedures, 153 minutes
for colectomy procedures, and 125 minutes for anterior spine procedures.
Each being comparable to operative times for comparable procedures
when not using the additive benefits of these technologies. The
average number of times the laparoscope was removed to clean its
tip per 60-minute interval during these procedures was 1.0 compared
to 7.7 per 60-minute interval for comparable procedures when not
using the robotic arm technology.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Instrument Tracking and Voice Activation: The use
of the instrument tracking mechanism to move the visual operative
field by a color-coded instrument shaft was entirely successful
utilizing motions to the left, to the right, in an upward direction,
or a downward direction. However, the ability of the instrument
tracking mechanism to move the field inward and outward was less
successful. Further, the use of complex skills with instrumentation
all were successfully accomplished when the tracking was inactivated.
However, if the surgeon required movement of the visual field
during the performance of a complex skill utilizing this instrumentation,
then instrument tracking was unable to accomplish movement of
the visual field.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Voice activation of the robotic arm to accomplish
movement of the visual operative field of view was entirely successful.
Motions to the right and left, up and down, as well as in and
out, were all successfully accomplished with ease. However, two
voice commands were always necessary; the command to start the
motion of the robotic arm and the command to &quot;stop&quot;.
Further, the use of voice activation as a mechanism to move the
visual field in small increments when necessary - especially during
performance of laparoscopic complex skills, provided a solution
to movement of the visual field during the performance of skills
with the surgeon's instruments.<BR>

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=2>DISCUSSION<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The use of the robotic arm to enhance minimally invasive
operative procedures is identified and delineated in these studies
in a variety of ways. Use of robotics to enhance the opportunity
for a surgeon to perform solo-surgery without increasing the length
of the operative procedures is delineated in Phase I of our study
using laparoscopic cholecystectomy, laparoscopic hernia repair,
and laparoscopic nissen fundoplication. Further, there were no
technical mishaps and no technical complications either related
or unrelated. This data diminishes cost and resource utilization
by allowing either a surgeon-first assistant or a physician's
assistant to not be utilized, thus allowing these medical personnel
to be free to perform other healthcare interventions for other
patients. It should be noted that no additional equipment was
required to perform solo-surgery, thus the resource &quot;trade-off&quot;
is the robotic arm in exchange for versatile medical personnel.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In circumstances in which laparoscopic nissen fundoplication
and cholecystectomy were performed utilizing the solo-surgeon
methodology, the procedures usually involve four ports (cholecystectomy)
or five ports (nissen fundoplication). In these circumstances,
there are often three personnel participating in the operative
procedure. These include the surgeon, the first assistant and
the camera holder. As a result, these latter two procedures may
actually be modified by the solo-surgeon concept in order to exchange
two medical personnel for a modified preoperative setup and robotic
arm enhancement.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The solo-surgeon experiences have raised two important
issues to the surgeon's consciousness. The first is that the use
of the robotic arm diminishes the number of occasions per 60-minute
interval that the laparoscope must be removed and cleaned at the
tip. Since each occasion of removal and defogging uses time and
also defocuses the surgeon, then the reduction in these cleaning
maneuvers should result in a shortening of the operative time
as well as diminishing risk due to defocusing of the surgeon's
attention during a procedure. Further, since the robotic arm holds
the position of the scope and the surgeon's optical field of view
motionless and perfectly stationary, it allows for a much more
stable and concentrated field of view for the surgeon to work.
This phenomenon would seem to eventually translate into shortened
operating time, increased concentration, decreased fatigue, and
a diminution in risk of operative error.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The use of the robotic arm to enhance the efficiency
and safety of complex minimally invasive procedures along with
the synergistic benefits of other sophisticated technologies clearly
is practical and imminently possible. In our series, the addition
of multiple complex technologies did not lengthen the operative
procedures and did not result in technical mishaps. Further, the
reduction of medical personnel from three individuals to two personnel
invariably occurred diminishing cost and human resource utilization.
The robotic arm itself maintained a stable and motionless operative
field for the surgeon throughout the cases and minimized the number
of scope cleaning events. Both of these factors increased the
concentration and focus of the surgeon providing continuity to
the procedure without interruption. The use of the HMD in all
circumstances allowed the surgeon to maintain a normal hand-eye
axis allowing the work to be in front of the surgeon with his/her
visual field exactly in the same plane as the laparoscopic procedure
being performed. This benefit diminished fatigue, accommodated
a non-paradoxical approach to the procedural tasks and eliminated
the risks and inefficiencies associated with paradoxical motion
(either related to a disparity in the location of the visual monitor
or a disparity in the location of the relationship between the
surgeon and his work<SUP>7</SUP>).</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A further benefit perceived by the surgeon when using
the HMD is the binocular vision which occurs because of the dual
liquid crystal displays in the HMD. The left-sided display provides
a visual field for the left eye and the right-sided display provides
a visual field for the right eye. This binocular vision gives
the surgeon a perception of depth and allows the eyes to fix on
a very distant focal point to reduce eye fatigue. When coupled
with 3-D technology, the HMD brings the surgeon binocular vision
and depth. As a result, a &quot;normal&quot; three-dimensional
field is perceived as opposed to an &quot;exaggerated&quot; three-dimensional
field as perceived when the active 3-D glasses are used along
with the 3-D active monitor. It might also be noted that the cost
of the HMD in exchange for the active 3-D glasses and the 3-D
monitor provides a major savings as well as technical safety and
efficiency.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Three-dimensional technology itself adds depth to
the visual operative field diminishing the risk of technical error
inherent when working in a two-dimensional field. Further, the
surgeon is not required to spend time and excess motions developing
tactile clues to accommodate for the lack of depth in the two-dimensional
field. This phenomenon can be translated into shorter operating
times.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Harmonic Scalpel (LCS) adds a subsequent degree
of increased efficiency and diminished risk to the aforementioned
technologies during complex minimally invasive surgical procedures.
The LCS is a highly versatile instrument which cuts, coagulates,
retracts, grasps, and bluntly dissects<SUP>8</SUP>. Therefore,
its versatility diminishes cost in three separate ways: it eliminates
the need for a variety of other instruments; it diminishes the
number of instrument exchanges performed during a complex procedure,
and it uses ultrasonic energy to cut and coagulate rather than
using monopolar cautery. The use of the LCS eliminates the need
for endoscopic scissors, endoscopic multiple clip applier, monopolar
cautery, cautery line, and grounding pad. Elimination of these
items reduced direct costs. The reduction in instrument exchanges
maintains the surgeon's focus on the procedure and diminishes
the waste of time and loss of concentration which occurs to the
operating team during instrument exchanges. Lastly, the elimination
of the risk of monopolar cautery when using the LCS may be translated
to decreased cost due to decreased risk.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The use of a foot pedal to control the robotic arm
and the subsequent operative field of view laparoscopically in
complex minimally invasive surgical procedures presents a rather
unique experience. At one extreme, many complex procedures (subtotal
colectomies, gastric resections, trauma cases) require movement
of the surgeon from one portion of the torso to another. The necessity
of surgeon mobility detracts from the effectiveness and efficiency
of the robotic foot pedal. On the other hand, many long complex
minimally invasive procedures are benefited from placing the surgeon
in the ergonomically beneficial sitting position which diminishes
the effective use of the foot pedal. Further, most surgeons have
other foot pedals as part of their procedure including either
the Harmonic Scalpel foot pedal or the cautery foot pedal. The
potential for increased complexity involving the robotic foot
pedal tends to diminish efficiency and effectiveness. Therefore,
we have attempted to utilize computerized instrument tracking
and voice activation as alternative methods to direct the surgical
field of view by way of the robotic arm. These experiences have
delineated that the use of a blue color activated tracking system
on the shaft of an instrument accomplishes efficient movement
of the field of view to left and right as well as up and down.
However, a number of movements are not successfully accomplished
by instrument tracking. First, the &quot;in&quot; and &quot;out&quot;
positions require a command other than instrument tracking. Secondly,
an additional command is required to de-activate instrument tracking
in order for the surgeon to utilize his instrument for a technical
task while simultaneously holding the field of view steady. In
addition, once the instrument tracking system has been de-activated
and the surgeon is using his instruments for a technical task,
the requirement for a small or moderate alteration in the visual
field to accommodate the surgeon cannot be accomplished by instrument
tracking because the instruments are being used for the surgical
task. Therefore, an additional command is necessary in this latter
circumstance. The addition of a prototype voice activation system
allows the surgeon to move the field of view inward and outward.
It also provides the opportunity to deactivate and reactivate
the instrument tracking system. Finally, the voice activation
and voice command may be used to accomplish fine movements while
performing a delicate surgical task with the instruments. We believe
this combination of control devices will further improve efficiency
and versatility of the robotic arm to enhance minimally invasive
surgical procedures.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>These data delineate that each of the technologies
described improve safety, diminish resource utilization, improve
efficiency and versatility for the surgeon, and are clearly usable
synergistically together to maximize the benefits for the patient.
The authors strongly believe that further investigations to study
the details of each of these technologies and their respective
benefits are urgent and necessary.<BR>
