<A NAME = "WHERE">
<H2>Where is the software?</H2>
</A>

All the software is located, naturally enough, in the <i>Software</i> 
directory at the top level of the CD directory.  

<A NAME = "HOW">
<H2>How is the software organized?</H2>

It's organized by software package, each having it's own 
directory containing the application and associated files.  

In the <i>Main</i> group, run the <i>File Manager.</i>
Go to the CD and browse the <i>Software</i> directory.  
You'll see few directories and/or files. 
Let's briefly go over what each software package does:<p>

<ul type=circle>

<p>
Unfortunately, <i>NIH Image</i> is not provided with the PC version
of this CD. The main reason is no <i>NIH Image</i> version exists 
that will run under MS-Windows 3.1.
