<TITLE>SRL-1 - Raco biomass map</TITLE>
<H1>Raco biomass map</H1>
<P>
This biomass map of the Raco, Michigan, area was produced from
data acquired by the Spaceborne Imaging Radar C/X-Band Synthetic
Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) onboard space shuttle Endeavour. 
Biomass is the amount of plant material on an area of Earth's
surface.  Radar can directly sense the quantity and
organizational structure of the woody biomass in the forest. 
Science team members at the University of Michigan used the radar
data to estimate the standing biomass for this Raco site in the
Upper Peninsula of Michigan.  Detailed surveys of 70 forest
stands will be used to assess the accuracy of these techniques. 
The seasonal growth of terrestrial plants, and forests in
particular, leads to the temporary storage of large amounts of
carbon, which could directly affect changes in global climate.  
In order to accurately predict future global change, scientists
need detailed information about current distribution of
vegetation types and the amount of biomass present around the
globe.  Optical techniques to determine net biomass are
frustrated by chronic cloud-cover.  Imaging radar can penetrate
through cloud-cover with negligible signal losses.
