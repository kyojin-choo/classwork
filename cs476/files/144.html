<h3>Movie Stunt Goes Bad, One Dead, Others Hurt</h3>

NAPLES, Fla, (AP) - A boat used in a stunt on the set of a Walt Disney movie careened out of control today and landed in a group of people, killing one person and injuring several others.<p>

Eyewitnesses described the victims as stunt men or extras for the movie "Gone Fishin", which stars Joe Pesci and Danny Glover.<p>

The number of people injured and the extent of their injuries was not immediately available, Collier County Sheriff's Sgt. Jimmy Snell.(sic)<p>

Details were sketchy, but officials said the boat was due to go up a ramp and fly through the air and land in a group of boats. Instead, it came off the ramp to one side and flipped upside-down.<p>

"Something went wrong and the boat landed in a crowd of people," Snell said.<p>

The movie, which also stars Rosanna Arquette,,, Lynn Whitfield, and Nick Brimble, is a comedy about what can go wrong when two New Jersey guys (Pesci and Glover) win a dream fishing trip to Florida.<p>

It was being filmed in the Big Cyprus Swamp, on the southwest tip of the state in the Everglades.<p>
