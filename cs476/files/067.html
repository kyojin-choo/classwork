<H1>Kliuchevskoi Volcano optical/radar comparison</H1> 
<P> 
This comparison shows optical and radar imaging of Kliuchevshoi
volcano in Kamchatka, Russia, which began to erupt on September
30, 1994, as space shuttle mission STS-68 was beginning with its
Spaceborne Imaging Radar C/X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar
(SIR-C/X-SAR) payload.

The optical photo at left was taken by shuttle astronauts during
the early hours of the eruption on September 30.  The ash plume,
which reached heights of more than 18 kilometers (50,000 feet), is 
emerging from a vent on the north flank of Kliuchevskoi, partially hidden 
by the plume and its shadow in this view.  The photograph is 
oriented with north toward the bottom, for comparison with 
the radar image at right acquired a few 
days later.  Near the center of the photo, a small whitish 
steam plume may be seen emanating from the growing lava dome 
of a companion volcano, Bezymianny.

In the radar image at right, Kliuchevskoi is the blue triangular peak in 
the center of the image, towards the left edge of the bright red 
area that delineates bare snow cover.  The image was 
acquired by SIR-C/X-SAR aboard the space shuttle 
Endeavour on its 88th orbit on October 5, 1994.  The image 
shows an area approximately 75 kilometers by 100 kilometers 
(46 miles by 62 miles) that is centered at 56.07 degrees 
north latitude and 160.84 degrees east longitude.  North is 
toward the bottom of the image.  The radar illumination is 
from the top of the image.  The Kamchatka volcanoes are 
among the most active volcanoes in the world.  The volcanic 
zone sits above a tectonic plate boundary, where the Pacific 
plate is sinking beneath the northeast edge of the Eurasian 
plate. The Endeavour crew obtained dramatic video and 
photographic images of this region during the eruption, 
which will assist scientists in analyzing the dynamics of 
the recent activity. The colors in this image were obtained 
using the following radar channels: red represents the L-
band (horizontally transmitted and received); green 
represents the L-band (horizontally transmitted and 
vertically received); blue represents the C-band 
(horizontally transmitted and vertically received).  In 
addition to Kliuchevskoi, two other active volcanoes are 
visible in the image.  Bezymianny, the circular crater above 
and to the right of Kliuchevskoi, contains a slowly growing 
lava dome.  Tolbachik is the large volcano with a dark 
summit crater near the upper right edge of the red snow 
covered area.  The Kamchatka River runs from right to left 
across the bottom of the image.  The current eruption of 
Kliuchevskoi included massive ejections of gas, vapor and 
ash, which reached altitudes of 15,000 meters (50,000 feet).  
Melting snow mixed with volcanic ash triggered mudflows on 
the flanks of the volcano.  Paths of these flows can be seen 
as thin lines in various shades of blue and green on the 
north flank in the center of the image.
