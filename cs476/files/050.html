<h2>July Recipes</h2>
<h3>from EarthSave</h3>
There&#146;s nothing more refreshing and nutritious on a summer&#146;s
day than fresh fruit. Fruit is a great source of soluble fibre,
vitamin C and phytochemicals (protective chemicals from plants).
This month you&#146;ll find four recipes for tasty fruit drinks,
as well as other ideas for adding more fruit to your diet.
<P>
<h3>Quick 'n' Easy Refreshing Fruit Drinks</h3>
<menu>
<li>Lemon Aid
<li>3 apples
<li>1 lemon
</menu>
<P>
Use vegetable peeler to remove the yellow layer from the lemon,
keeping as much of the white pulp as possible. Juice apples, then
lemon and stir together. Serve with ice. Nutri options: Add 1
tsp flax seed oil to supply daily requirement of omega-3 fatty
acids and improve the balance of essential fats. 
<P>

<h3>Carrot and Fruit Shake</h3>
This drink is a great vitamin cocktail. It provides over 100%
of the daily requirement of vitamin A; 34% of B6; and over 100%
of vitamin E, riboflavin, thiamin and niacin.
<menu>
<li>3 carrots
<li>1 apple
<li>1 frozen banana
</menu>
<P>
Juice carrots and apple. Run the banana under hot water to help
remove the skin. Chop banana and blend with carrot/apple juice.
Make your own combination by playing with the amounts of each
ingredient or add some lemon, lime or other fruit on hand. Nutri
options: Add a tsp of Red Star Nutritional Yeast T-6635+ for extra
B vitamins, including B12.

<h3>Fresh Fruit Shake</h3>

peaches, yogurt or other ingredients of your choice. The soy milk
and tofu provide high-quality protein, essential fats and a host
of protective phytochemicals which are potent antioxidants.
<menu>
<li>1 frozen banana

<h3>Berry Good Slushie</h3>

juice, it&#146;s far tastier and more nutritious than any commercial
slushie. 
<menu>
<li>1/2 tin frozen juice concentrate
<li>1 cup berries

<h3>Citrus Sunshine Muffins</h3>
<menu>
<li>1 cup oats
<li>3/4 cup soy milk
<li>peel of 1 lemon
<li>juice and pulp of 2 lemons (about 1/4 cup)

<li>1/2 pkg medium tofu
<li>1/3 cup brown sugar
<li>2 cups unbleached flour
<li>1 tbsp baking powder (alum-free)
<li>1/4 tsp sea salt

Combine oats and soy milk and let soak for 10 minutes. Place tofu
in a large bowl and beat until creamy. Add the oat/soy milk mixture,
the lemon and orange juices and pulp, lemon peel, and brown sugar.
Mix well. Add the remaining dry ingredients, mix and pour into
lightly-greased muffin tins. Optional: Peel the 2 whole oranges
and carefully cut each into several thin, round slices. Place
one round slice on top of each muffin. Bake at 350 degrees for
25-30 minutes. Serve warm. Store in refrigerator. Nutri options:
To improve the fibre and nutrient content, add 1 tbsp of ground
flax seeds to the oat/soy milk mixture; use whole wheat flour
in place of unbleached flour and increase the soy milk to 1 cup.
Alternatively, you could replace a 1/4 cup of the flour with a
1/4 cup wheat germ.

<h3>Raw Berry Pie</h3>
A simple, no-bake fresh fruit torte that provides plenty of B
vitamins and vitamin C as well as being high in fibre, low in
saturated fat and cholesterol-free.
<menu>
<li>1 basket strawberries, stems trimmed
<li>1 basket raspberries
<li>1 cup fruit juice
<li>1 tbsp agar flakes
<li>Almond Pie Crust (see below)
</menu>
<P>
Trim and wash the berries, and place on paper towels to drain.
Arrange on the Almond Pie crust. Mix the fruit juice with the
agar flakes in a small pot, bring to a boil for a minute, then
simmer for another minute. Let stand a couple of minutes before
pouring over the fruit. Chill to set.
<h3>Almond Pie Crust:</h3>
<menu>
<li>1 cup almonds, soaked
<li>1/3 cup raisins or currants
<li>2 tbsp tahini
<li>1/2 tsp vanilla extract
</menu>
<P>
Pulse chop ingredients together in a food processor until a paste
forms. You may need to stop and scrape down the sides of the food
processor a couple of times while processing. Spread into a 9&#148;
pie dish using wet fingers. Freeze an hour to set, or you can
bake it at 250 degrees for 30 minutes, before filling. Nutri options:
To make this recipe almost fat-free, omit the crust. Simply arrange
the berries in parfait glasses then pour in the agar/juice mixture.
Chill to set. Or to further improve the nutrient content of the
pie, spread a layer of tofu cream on the crust before adding berries.
(To make tofu cream: mix 1 pkg firm or extra firm silken tofu,
1/4 cup maple syrup, 1 tsp vanilla, and 2 tbsp lemon juice in
a blender until smooth.)
<P>
Serves 6. Per serving: calories: 236; fat: 15g; carbohydrate:
21g; protein: 8g; fibre 5g. Percentage of calories from fat: 54%.
Note: analysis was done using the almond crust and berry filling.

<P>
<h3>Rhubarb Compote</h3>
<P>
A stewed rhubarb, good hot or cold. Serve over soy ice cream,
on a thin piece of cake, or even on your pancakes or oatmeal.
The dried fruits are an excellent source of soluble fibre and
are helpful in reducing blood cholesterol levels.
<menu>
<li>5 cups rhubarb, cut into 2&#148; pieces
<li>1/3 to 1/2 cup sweetener of your choice
<li>1/2 tsp orange or lemon zest
<li>1/4 cup water
<li>1/4 cup currants
<li>1 cup apple, peeled and sliced
</menu>
<P>
Place all ingredients in a medium-sized saucepan, cover and bring
to a boil. Reduce heat, cook on low for 5 minutes, until rhubarb
is soft. Stir and sweeten to taste if needed. Serve hot or cold.
<P>
Makes 8 - 1/2 cup servings. Per serving: calories: 97; fat: 0.2g;
carbohydrate: 24g; protein: 1g; fibre: 2g. Percentage of calories
from fat: 2%.
<P>
<B>From our dietitians:</B>
<P>
Have you come across advertising that claims that the calcium
from plant foods is poorly absorbed? Spinach is typically held
up as an example. While it is true that we only absorb about 5%
of the calcium from spinach, due to its high oxalate content,
it is incorrect to assume that this automatically applies to all
vegetables. In fact, for low-oxalate vegetables such as broccoli,
turnip, kale, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower and Chinese greens,
absorption is 50-70%, compared to approximately 32% for cow&#146;s
milk, 31% for tofu, 21% for nuts and seeds, and 17% for legumes.
