<P>The integrated national-regional model produces consistent regional
forecasts.  The system is used as the basis of reports published in February and
July each year.  The need for a satisfactory national model is widely
recognised.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>... the most valuable early warning system is likely to be an econometric
model which generates detailed and reliable long-term forecasts for any economy.
 Such models have a distinctly patchy reputation, but some have emerged with
notable credit from the experiences of the last year or so.  In particular, the
Multisectoral Dynamic Model of the UK economy (MDM), developed by Cambridge
Econometrics Limited, performed impressively in identifying and quantifying the
slowdown in UK economic growth which occurred from late 1989.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The February report is based on the ONS's regional data published in
December of the previous year and on CE's view of the national economy.  The
July report is based on CE's June national forecast and further releases of
regional data from the ONS. This report also includes scenarios and special
features.  Previous topics have included: the effect of the Single European
Market on the regions; the economic future of the South East; regional
employment change in the UK service sector in the 1980s; economic prospects for
the north of England; the outlook for regional housing markets with implications
for economic activity; the regional impact of sterling's devaluation in
September 1992; unemployment, house prices and the recession in 1990-92 with an
intercounty comparison; the relationship between house prices and migration;
spatial disparities in employment growth in Great Britain over the past decade;
spatial disparities in the formation rate of new firms; prospects for
high-technology industry; labour migration and regional disparities in
competitiveness; commuting to workplaces; and foreign manufacturing in the UK
regions. Special features in the February and July 1996 reports include: 
regional unemployment disparities in the UK - some comparisons with other member
states of the EU; the effect of EU regeneration funding in local areas of the UK
- the case of Merseyside; and spatial variations in small business development
and employment generation in the UK.</P>
