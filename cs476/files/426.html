SENATE VOTES
<P>
<a name="s1"></a>
1.  <b>BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT</b>.  Passage of the joint resolution to pass a
constitutional amendment to balance the budget by the year 2002 or two years after ratification by
the states.  Rejected 65-35, March 2, 1995.  (A two-thirds majority of those present and voting is
required to pass a constitutional amendment.)  ACU supported the amendment.  [Senate Majority
Leader Robert Dole was credited with a favorable vote on this resolution, because his NO vote
was merely a procedural maneuver designed to allow him to call for a re-vote at a later date,
should he garner one more favorable vote for the Balanced Budget Amendment.]

2.  <b>PUSH-BUTTON STRIKES</b>.  Motion to invoke cloture (thus allowing the measure to be voted
on) on the Kassebaum amendment to block the implementation of a presidential executive order
barring federal contractors from permanently replacing striking workers.  The executive order had
overturned sixty years of established labor law.  Rejected 58-39, March 15, 1995.  (Three-fifths of
the total Senate, or 60 votes, is required to invoke cloture.)  ACU supported the cloture motion.
<P>
<a name="s3"></a>
3.  <b>LINE-ITEM VETO</b>.  Passage of the bill to provide the president with the ability to veto
individual line items in an appropriations bill, targeted tax breaks in a revenue bill, or new
entitlement spending.  Approved 69-29, March 23, 1995.  ACU supported the bill.
<P>
<a name="s4"></a>
4.  <b>PRODUCT LIABILITY OVERHAUL</b>.  Passage of the bill to rewrite the rules governing
product liability suits in federal and state courts, capping punitive damages against small
companies and placing new limits on such awards against larger companies, there
by reducing consumer costs and increasing product availability.  Approved 61-37, May 10, 1995. 
ACU supported the bill.
<P>
<a name="s5"></a>
5.  <b>TAX CUTS</b>.  Gramm amendment to the budget resolution to provide tax cuts similar to those
provided by the House, including a $500-per child credit, a reduction in the capital gains tax rate,
an expansion of IRAs, and the elimination of the marriage penalty in the tax code.  Rejected
31-69, May 23, 1995.  ACU supported the amendment.
<P>
<a name="s6"></a>
6.  <b>WELFARE FOR POLITICIANS</b>.  Kerry amendment to strike from the budget resolution the
provisions that eliminate the Presidential Campaign Fund that is supported by a check-off on tax
returns.  [Under current law, major party candidates for president are supported by taxpayer
funds.  The Senate GOP budget resolution would have ended that.  The Kerry amendment sought
to continue taxpayer funding of presidential campaigns.]  Approved 56-44, May 24, 1995.  ACU
opposed the amendment.
<P>
<a name="s7"></a>
7. <b>DEATH PENALTY DELAYS</B>.  Kyl amendment to prohibit federal habeas corpus appeals in state cases if a state has adequate and effective remedies to test the legality of the individual's detention.  The habeas corpus appeal is the most commonly-used legal tactic to delay the implementation of the death penalty against convicted murderers.  Rejected 38-61, June 7, 1995.  ACU supported the amendment.
<P>

supported the amendment.
<P>
<a name="s10"></a>
10.  <b>RYAN WHITE REAUTHORIZATION</b>.  Kassebaum amendment to the Ryan White
Reauthorization bill, which would authorize new funds for AIDS research.  The Kassebaum
amendment gutted the tougher Helms amendment, which had passed earlier in the day, which
would have prevented funds from being used directly or indirectly to promote homosexuality or
intravenous drug use.  The Helms amendment defined "promotion" broadly; the Kassebaum
amendment included no such definition.  Approved 76-23, July 27, 1995.  ACU opposed the
amendment.

Chinese government.  Rejected 43-57, September 21, 1995.  ACU supported the amendment.

to require the president to submit within six months a plan to cut $3 billion over four years by
abolishing two of the three foreign affairs agencies (the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency,
the Agency for International Development, and the U.S. Information Agency).  Rejected 43-57,
September 21, 1995.  ACU opposed the motion.
<P>
<a name="s17"></a>

1995.  ACU opposed the amendment.
<P>
<a name="s20"></a>
18.  <b>WELFARE FOR LOBBYISTS</b>.  Craig substitute amendment to the Simpson amendment to
the Campbell amendment.  The Craig amendment would bar large organizations that receive
federal grants from spending more than $1 million of the first $17 million of their budget on
lobbying activity.  The Simpson amendment would also prohibit large nonprofit lobbying
organizations from receiving federal grants and would require all federal grant recipients other
than individuals who receive more than $25,000 to report their lobbying costs.  Approved 49-47,
November 9, 1995.  ACU supported the amendment.
<P>
