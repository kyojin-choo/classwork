This radar image shows the Star City cosmonaut training center, east of
Moscow, Russia. Four American astronauts are training here for
future long-duration flights aboard the Russian Mir space station. These
joint flights are giving NASA and the Russian Space Agency
experience necessary for the construction of the international Alpha
space station, beginning in late 1997. This image was acquired by the
Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar
(SIR-C/X-SAR), on its 62nd orbit on October 3, 1994. This Star City
image
is centered at 55.55 degrees north latitude and 38.0 degrees east
longitude. The area shown is approximately 32 kilometers by 49
kilometers
(20 miles by 30 miles). North is to the top in this image. The radar
illumination is from the top of the image. The image was produced using
three channels of SIR-C radar data: red indicates L-band (23 cm
wavelength, horizontally transmitted and received); green indicates
L-band
(horizontally transmitted and vertically received); blue indicates
C-band (6 cm wavelength, horizontally transmitted and vertically
received).
In general, dark pink areas are agricultural; pink and light blue areas
are urban communities; black areas represent lakes and rivers; dark blue
areas are cleared forest; and light green areas are forested. The
prominent black runways just right of center are Shchelkovo Airfield,
about 4
km long. The textured pale blue-green area east and southeast of
Shchelkovo Airfield is forest. Just east of the runways is a thin
railroad line
running southeast; the Star City compound lies just east of the small
bend in the rail line. Star City contains the living quarters and
training
facilities for Russian cosmonauts and their families. Moscow's inner
loop road is visible at the lower left edge of the image. The Kremlin is
just off the left edge, on the banks of the meandering Moskva River. The
Klyazma River snakes to the southeast from the reservoir in the
upper left (shown in bright red), passing just east of Star City and
flowing off the lower right edge of the image. The dark blue band of the
Vorya River runs north-south in the upper right quadrant, east of Star
City. SIR-C/X-SAR radar images are being compared with data from
the Russian radar satellite Almaz to evaluate the usefulness of a
permanent orbital radar platform in monitoring Earth s environment and
ecology.
