<h2>Recovery and the Art of Movement</h2>
<h3>by Mike Santry</h3>

It's good to be a seeker, but sooner or later you have to be a
finder. And then it is well to give what you have found, a gift
into the world for whoever will accept it.
<P>
<b>-Jonathan Livingston Seagull</b>
<P>
Some people go through life seeking and never finding. Others
seek, find and then assist others in their own quests.
<P>
Barbara Mindell started her search shortly after a car crash at
the age of 18 left her a paraplegic. While no one at the hospital
told her she would never walk again, it was the impression she
was left with. &quot;I never really bought the idea that I'd never
walk,&quot; she says. &quot;If there was a God, there was a possibility
that I could recover from this injury.&quot;
<P>
Conventional North American medical wisdom didn't have the answers
she was looking for. &quot;Doctors think about the human body
as one would a car or a machine. Once grown, it doesn't grow or
regenerate. It eventually falls apart and they just fix the parts
along the way.&quot; she says. Mindell spent the next ten years
exploring the alternative healing methods, including bodywork,
massage and acupuncture. She sent out 250 form letters to health
and scientific organizations around the world asking people to
work with her. She received nothing more than good wishes in reply.
<P>
In the course of her search, Mindell met Emilie Conrad-Da'oud
and was introduced to Continuum-something she describes as &quot;a
primary movement process which explores movement as something
we are, rather than something we do.&quot; Conrad-Da'oud invented
and developed this process, which Mindell says is an ever-changing,
ever-evolving inquiry into the nature of what it means to be a
human being.
<P>
Mindell learned from Conrad-Da'oud to breathe in a manner that
created a wave-like motion generated from the part of her body
that could move. The wave motion radiates through the body, spreading
tiny movements and signaling dormant areas to participate. The
concept has been described as 'breaking ice to get to water.'
Mindell suggests we entertain the notion that we are open systems
with endless possibilities for innovation, and the development
of new neural pathways, new connections, new ways to identify
ourselves. She describes her experience with the Continuum as
having been a way to transform herself. It's like entering into
a new life, shedding an old skin-and doing it in a loving environment,
she says.
<P>
Conrad-Da'oud teaches that human beings develop in an aquatic
atmosphere while in the womb and are fundamentally aquatic beings.
Our earliest developments take place with movements similar to
those of the sea-fluttering, irregular to the eye, and experimental.
Undifferentiated movement (wave-motion) allows for nerves to innovate,
and the more specific a movement is (such as weight training),
the less neural information there is in it. The wave motion process
allows for aquatic-like movements within the body.
<P>
As the neural information spreads from the wave motion, probabilities
for new synaptic activity (to be generated by hook-ups among the
thousands of neural signals traveling through the body) develop.
Hook-ups between new neural pathways, formerly-used muscles, and
as-yet-unknown pathways for movement may also be created.
<P>
Mindell realized the healing had to come from within. &quot;It
wasn't a process where the 'patient' is passive and the other
person 'fixes' them,&quot; she says.
<P>
&quot;I had a willingness to participate. I was ready. The spiritual
aspect of the healing for me was all-important. As I started to
get sensation, as I started to move, areas of my body that were
paralyzed showed me that movement and sensation were the result
of a much deeper process. I went through a long process of letting
go of the struggling against the paralysis. There's a lot of that
in living a life in a wheelchair, forcing and pushing, struggling...&quot;
<P>
Mindell says she was able to become more general in her awareness
and not always focus on her legs and wanting to walk. &quot;It's
really not a process of dealing directly with the issue; it's
much more expansive. In any transformation process, you can't
be overly focused on paralysis. It creates more of the same-a
loop. So for myself in this process it hasn't been just healing
the paralysis; it's more than just that-spiritual growth, development,
being able to have a full life, have a career as an artist, being
in a relationship and being able to move in many different ways.
Through this process, the increase in sensation has been enormous.
The feeling of fluidity and movement in my body has been an incredible
healing.&quot;
<P>
Although not quite ambul-atory, Mindell now has sensation and
movement throughout her lower body. Her investigation into movement
has led to profound insights into the creative capacity of our
biological systems and has far-reaching implications for the healing
community. To all of us paralysed in various ways, she is an example
of what a body can be.

Barbara Mindell will be speaking on Moving through Paralysis on
Friday, Oct. 4, and conducting a workshop entitled The Art of
Movement, in Vancouver, October 5-6 at the Holiday Inn, 1110 Howe
Street. Pre-registration is required. Contact Doris Maranda, (604)
947-0147 for more information/registration.
