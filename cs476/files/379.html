</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

This chapter outlines some criminal law issues and focuses on misdemeanors, for which punishments are relatively less severe than for felonies. Felonies are covered in the <A HREF="c13.html">Criminal Law: Felonies &amp; White Collar Crime</A> Chapter, along with white collar crimes, the rights of persons accused of crimes, and the rights of crime victims.
<P>
This chapter also discusses driving-under-the-influence violations, as well as the juvenile justice system. The <A HREF="c16.html">Family Law</A> Chapter covers domestic abuse and protective orders, and the <A HREF="c03.html">Process of a Case: Civil &amp; Criminal</A> Chapter describes criminal procedure. Private causes of action that result from criminal conduct are covered in the Personal Injury Law Chapters.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Criminal Codes </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Criminal law defines conduct that is prohibited by the government and the range of penalties that can be imposed for violating these prohibitions. Depending on the nature of the crime, a person who violates a criminal law incurs penalties including fines and/or imprisonment. By definition, misdemeanors are crimes for which a person may be committed to no more than one year of imprisonment. Illinois also has laws that allow the authorities to seize property connected with the commission of a crime. For example, a person convicted repeatedly for driving under the influence of alcohol may have his or her driver's license confiscated and driving privileges revoked by the government. Similarly, a person charged with violating laws connected with controlled substances must forfeit the substances as well as the raw materials used to make the drugs, vehicles and real property used to further the crime, and any money or other proceeds from the sale of the controlled substances.
<P>
Every crime is defined by a list of elements. In a criminal trial, the prosecutor attempts to prove all the elements of the crime the person is accused of committing. If all elements are proven, the judge or the jury finds the person guilty of the crime. However, even for minor criminal violations, the accused may not be found guilty unless the jury or judge finds him or her guilty "beyond a reasonable doubt."
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="30"><H2><STRONG>Attempt, Conspiracy, Aiding and Abetting </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Anyone who, with intent to commit a crime, takes a substantial step toward committing the crime may be guilty of attempt to commit a crime. Merely thinking about committing a crime, or even preparing to commit a crime, is not an attempt; there must be a substantial step. For example, if a group of teenagers talks about how easy they think it would be to walk out of a store with a pair of jeans, they have not committed a crime, nor have they committed an attempted crime. However, if they deactivate a store's alarm system so it cannot detect what passes through the doors, they probably have committed a tampering or vandalism crime as well as attempted theft. They have taken a substantial step toward the commission of the theft.
The law of conspiracy and the law of aiding and abetting are other general doctrines that apply to a wide range of offenses. Conspiracy is an agreement between two or more persons to commit a crime. For example, if three people conspire to preclude all potential renters who fall within a protected group from renting apartments in their building, and if the apartment manager actually rejects those people, they all can be charged with both conspiracy and violating the civil rights law. Even if a conspirator backs out of the conspiracy, but the other conspirators commit the crime, all conspirators may be criminally liable if the acts were reasonably foreseeable.
<P>
A person who aids or advises another in committing a crime may be guilty of aiding and abetting, and may be criminally liable for the acts of the other person, as well. Thus, if someone intentionally advises another how to commit a crime, both people are equally liable under the law.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="40"><H2><STRONG>Misdemeanors </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Criminal codes penalize a variety of activities, and many offenses are listed as violations of the law under the Illinois Criminal Code. Under the Criminal Code, misdemeanors range from unlawfully interfering with a public utility to criminal trespass to a residence, a vehicle, or real property, to intentionally damaging a traffic sign or traffic light. Under the law, many crimes are misdemeanors on the first offense, but become felonies on the second offense. This means that, for example, retail theft of property valued at less than $150 is a misdemeanor the first time. If a person already has been convicted of retail theft (shoplifting) and is arrested again for a similar action, the person will be charged with felony retail theft.
<P>
As mentioned, misdemeanors usually carry a maximum punishment of a fine and less than one year of incarceration. Crimes for which a person may be punished by more than one year in jail or in prison are categorized in Illinois as felonies.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Crimes Causing Harm to Property </STRONG></H3></A>
Theft, burglary, and robbery are felonies in Illinois unless the value of the property taken is under $300. Similarly, whether a crime against property is charged as a misdemeanor or a felony depends on the value of the property taken or damaged. The statute prohibiting criminal damage to property, for example, proscribes knowingly or recklessly damaging another's property, setting a fire on another's property, injuring another's domestic animal, and setting a stink bomb or other offensive-smelling compound on another's property. If the damage to the property is no more than $300, these crimes are misdemeanors; if the damage equals more than $300, the crimes are felonies. Similarly, criminal defacement of property is knowingly damaging another's property with paint, an etching tool, a writing instrument, or a similar device; the severity of punishment depends on the level of offense, which is a misdemeanor or felony depending on whether the property damage exceeds $300. In contrast, trespass to another person's property generally is a misdemeanor, while arson is always a felony.
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>Civil Rights Crimes </STRONG></H3></A>
The Illinois Human Rights Act forbids discrimination in employment, housing, financial credit, and public accommodations on the basis of age, ancestry, citizenship, color, disability, marital status, national origin, race, religion, sex, or unfavorable military discharge. Violation of these prohibitions can subject the violator to criminal prosecution.
<P>
<A NAME="70"><H3><STRONG>Sex Crimes </STRONG></H3></A>
Some actions involving sex are illegal misdemeanors under Illinois law, unless the person charged has been convicted of a previous offense or unless a child is involved, in which case they are felonies that carry more severe punishment. Prostitution, pimping, and solicitation are misdemeanors.
<P>
It is criminal sexual abuse, sometimes called statutory rape, for any one to have sexual penetration or sexual conduct with a victim under the age of 17. Criminal sexual abuse also can be sexual conduct other than sexual penetration in which force is used or the victim was unable to consent.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="80"><H2><STRONG>Alcohol and Drug-Related Traffic Offenses </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Alcohol and drug-related traffic offenses, commonly known as driving under the influence (DUI) are frequently prosecuted crimes in Illinois. If a person's blood alcohol concentration (BAC) is .10 or greater and the person is in physical control of a motor vehicle, he or she is considered to be driving under the influence. Even if a person's BAC is more than .05 but less than .10, the person may face DUI charges if there is other evidence to show DUI. It is a DUI-related offense to carry alcoholic beverages in a vehicle, unless the beverages are sealed in the original containers. A person also can be held liable for serving alcohol to someone who commits a DUI offense.
<P>
A person age 21 or over who is convicted of DUI the first time faces a mandatory sentence of losing driving privileges for at least one year, as well as possible imprisonment. If the person had a child in the car at the time of the arrest, the judge must add to the punishment a fine of $500 to $1000 and five days of community service. Subsequent convictions carry increased jail time, higher fines, mandatory community service for ten days, and/or loss of driving privileges for up to six years.
<P>
Illinois recently began a "zero tolerance" campaign to address the problem of DUI, especially among drivers under age 21. The first time a person under age 21 is convicted of DUI, he or she automatically loses driving privileges for two years and may face imprisonment and a fine, as well. Subsequent convictions have more severe mandatory penalties. For drivers under age 21, "zero tolerance" means it is illegal to drive with a BAC of more than .00, even if the BAC is not as high as what some people consider enough to make them intoxicated. For the first such offense a driver automatically loses his or her license for three months; for subsequent offenses he or she loses driving privileges for one year. Refusing to submit to chemical testing for BAC also carries with it a mandatory suspension of driving privileges.
Other alcohol or drug-related traffic offenses include reckless homicide (discussed in the <A HREF="c13.html">Criminal Law: Felonies &amp; White Collar Crime</A> Chapter) under the influence and aggravated DUI. Aggravated DUI is committed if the offender:
<UL>
<LI>Has three or more DUI convictions
<LI>Commits DUI while driving a school bus full of children
<LI>Is convicted of DUI after a collision that caused great bodily harm or permanent disfigurement or disability
<LI>Has a second DUI conviction after a DUI conviction that caused reckless homicide or great bodily injury
</UL>
Aggravated DUI carries with it a loss of driving privileges for one year, a minimum fine of $10,000, and possible imprisonment for one to three years.
<P>
Numerous other offenses connected to DUI are misdemeanors in Illinois. Offenses include:
<UL>
<LI>Falsifying a driver's license
<LI>Failing to carry valid automobile insurance
<LI>Allowing one's residence to be used by children under the age of 21 to drink
<LI>Selling alcohol to a minor or an intoxicated person
<LI>Knowingly renting a hotel or motel room to a person under the age of 21 who is drinking alcoholic beverages
<LI>Allowing a person under the influence of alcohol to operate one's vehicle
</UL>

<CENTER><A NAME="90"><H2><STRONG>Juveniles and the Law </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Illinois has a juvenile court system for minors that operates separately from other courts. The purpose of this separate system is to help serve the best interests of juveniles, rather than simply punish them. Generally, minors under age 17 who run afoul of the law are said to commit delinquent acts rather than crimes. The distinction is one of words only. Delinquent acts committed by a minor are called crimes if committed by an adult. Minors between the ages of 15 and 17 who commit certain crimes, such as first degree murder, are prosecuted as if they are adults.
<P>
The most significant distinction between the juvenile court system and adult criminal courts is in courtroom procedures. Juvenile courts generally are less formal than other courts. For example, minors being adjudicated or giving courtroom testimony in some cases can have a supportive person present during their testimony. Juvenile cases are heard in an adjudication hearing by a judge who determines the guilt or innocence of a minor accused of committing a delinquent act. Sometimes these hearings are closed to the public. Records made by law enforcement officers about delinquent minors must be kept confidential and separate from other arrest records. Only under certain circumstances may records from juvenile court be used in other legal proceedings.
<P>
Illinois has strict laws that seek to address juvenile gang violence. When the state seeks to try a violent juvenile delinquent on criminal charges, it may include in its petition evidence that the criminal activity was gang-related, and the judge may consider this evidence and order the minor tried as an adult. For example, if a 16-year-old minor allegedly committed a forcible felony that was part of criminal gang activity, and the minor already was declared a juvenile delinquent, the judge will order the case to be heard in criminal court.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="100"><H2><STRONG>Crime Victims' Rights </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Some crime victims have the right to compensation for the crimes committed against them. This means that a crime victim may receive compensation for certain expenses or losses, such as medical expenses or loss of support if the crime victim becomes unable to support dependents. There are requirements that must be met for a victim to get reimbursement, and victims must file an application for consideration with the Illinois Court of Claims for compensation. The maximum amount a victim can receive from the Court of Claims is $25,000.
<P>
Under some Illinois laws, the victim may receive compensation from the person who committed the crime. This is called restitution. For example, a person whose vehicle is stolen may be able to receive compensation for the vehicle. In this case, the state arranges to collect the money from the criminal and sends a check to the victim when all the restitution has been made.
<P>
The Illinois Victims Rights Constitutional Amendment gives all victims the right to be treated with fairness, the right to privacy, the right to make a statement at sentencing, and the right to reasonable protection from the accused during the criminal justice proceedings. Victims of the most violent crimes also have the right to be notified of the status of the investigation, whether an indictment has been brought, the time and place of any hearings, and when the defendant is released from custody.
<P>
If the court does not order restitution, or if a prosecutor does not press charges, the victim still has the option to seek compensation directly by suing the offender in civil court. This option is discussed more fully in the <A HREF="c03.html">Process of a Case: Civil &amp; Criminal</A> Chapter.
