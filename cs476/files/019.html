Since the fall of communism, press freedom has spread throughout the former Soviet bloc. But this victory for free 
expression and the people's right to know has been heavily qualified nearly everywhere 
as governments have sought to influence the newly independent media, and journalists have been put at risk by the hazards of war and the growing pressure of organized 
crime. <BR>
<BR>
The press is clearly the most democratic institution in Russia, but in 1995 journalists 
received repeated ominous reminders that they are physically and politically vulnerable 
and cannot rely on the protection of the law. Vladislav Listyev, perhaps the most popular television personality in the country, was murdered in the hallway of his 
apartment building on March 1 in what was almost certainly a contract killing. And 
Natalya Alyakina, a free-lance correspondent for German news outlets, was shot dead 
in June by a soldier after clearing a Russian checkpoint near the southern Russian city 
of Budyonnovsk. In both cases, there are indications that the authorities are making 
no serious attempt to bring those responsible to justice. <BR>
<BR>
The Russian press was further threatened by government pressure and the power of commercial 
interests as its own economic position grew steadily worse. NTV, Russia's largest 
financially and editorially independent television network, was threatened with losing its license over its unflinching reporting on the Chechen conflict. A criminal 
case was also opened against the NTV political satire show "Kukly" (Puppets), over 
a program in which government leaders were depicted as mendicant tramps. In some 
cases, the Russian press found itself beholden to sponsors or wealthy benefactors who tried--often 
successfully--to "buy" positive coverage for projects in which they were financially 
interested. <BR>
<BR>
In Central Asia, the situation for journalists was dire. In Tajikistan, a rash of 
murders of journalists that left 27 dead since May 1992 appeared to have ended with 
the last killing in November 1994. But then on Dec. 12, 1995, Mohyedin Alempour, 
the head of the BBC's Persian Service bureau, was killed in Dushanbe with a single shot to 
the head. In Uzbekistan, censors operating through the State Committee on the Press 
eliminated critical articles and screened newspapers for anything else that might 
be interpreted as anti-regime.<BR>
<BR>
In the Caucasus region, the press was frequently subject to prior censorship. But 
even in cases where the circulation of a newspaper was so low that the publication 
was not censored in advance, its contents were monitored carefully. In Azerbaijan, 
four journalists working for <CITE>Chesme, </CITE>
a satirical newspaper with a very limited print run, were arrested and sentenced to 
jail terms for "insulting the dignity" of President Geidar Aliyev by publishing caricatures 
of him.<BR>
<BR>
Although journalists in the European republics of the former Soviet Union and in Central 
Europe were less likely to face physical attacks, they were often exposed to government 
pressure. In Belarus, for instance, newspapers continued to appear with blank spaces because of censorship, and the government deprived several independent newspapers 
of printing rights at state-run facilities. In Romania, criminal proceedings were 
started against two journalists in connection with the publication of articles in 
which they alleged that President Ion Iliescu was recruited as a KGB agent while he 
was a student in Moscow. And in Albania, publication of the monthly humor magazine 
<CITE>Hostini </CITE>
was halted after the secret police learned that the magazine was preparing to publish 
a caricature of President Sali Berisha. <BR>
<BR>
In the former Yugoslavia, both the Croatian and Serb governments tried to put pressure 
on newspapers and other media outlets through bureaucratic means. And in Bosnia, 
journalists continued to be at high risk of being killed either by land mines, in 
the cross fire or as a result of deliberate targeting. There were also several cases of 
journalists being captured and used as hostages by Bosnian Serb fighters.<BR>

<H2>Hunting for Mass Graves Behind Serb Lines</H2>

by <A HREF="http://www.csmonitor.com/archive/-Jul-Nov95/recent9.html">David Rohde</a><BR>
<BR>
<CITE>The following article is </CITE>
Christian Science Monitor<CITE> reporter David Rohde's chronicle of how he was captured by the Bosnian Serbs in October 
1995 as he was investigating sites of mass executions near Zvornik. Charged with 
illegally entering Bosnian Serb territory and falsifying documents, Rohde was the 
first journalist to be tried and convicted of crimes by the Bosnian Serbs in retaliation 
for his reporting. After two weeks in captivity, he was pardoned and released on 
Nov. 8 as a result of efforts by several parties, including his family, the U.S. 
State Department, the </CITE>
Christian Science Monitor<CITE>, the United Nations, the International Red Cross and CPJ's chair, Kati Marton, who 
met with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic three times at the Dayton, Ohio, peace 
talks to pressure him to secure Rohde's freedom.<BR>

</CITE>
At the first Bosnian Serb checkpoint, everything started to go wrong. The Serb soldiers who normally let foreign journalists 
drive on their own to the nearby military barracks and request a press accreditation 
insisted they ride with me.<BR>
<BR>
I said I knew the way, but one young soldier circled around the car and opened the 
passenger side door. I shouted, "I know ... I know" in Serbian. He shrugged, shut 
the door and waved me through.<BR>
<BR>
I had no intention of stopping at the barracks. I didn't want a new Bosnian Serb press 
accreditation--a small, flimsy, unlaminated cardboard card with the name and date 
of issue and expiration filled in with ball point pen. An old accreditation that 
I had changed the date of issue on was hidden in the car.<BR>
<BR>
I had never doctored an accreditation before, but the Bosnian Serbs had turned down 
repeated requests from the United Nations, the International War Crimes Tribunal 
and journalists for free access to the areas around Srebrenica and Zepa since the 
two U.N.-declared "safe areas" fell in July. And a U.S. intelligence source told me the Bosnian 
Serbs had been seen tampering with--and possibly destroying evidence of--one of the 
mass graves I wanted to investigate. There was no other way to get to the graves 
and I had been told by Serb friends that I was on a Bosnian Serb "blacklist" for my past 
reporting and would never be allowed to enter their territory again.<BR>
<BR>
In August, I visited the site of two possible mass graves near Srebrenica identified 
by U.S. aerial photos. I found a decomposed human leg, a diploma and personal photos 
with Muslim names on them and documents from Srebrenica.<BR>
<BR>
In September, I'd found nine credible survivors of mass executions who had made it 
from Srebrenica to Muslim-held Central Bosnia. They described the mass execution 
of thousands of prisoners at a half-dozen locations.<BR>
<BR>
A few days before my trip in October, an intelligence source had given me the exact 
locations of four other possible mass graves around Srebrenica identified by U.S. 
spy planes and satellites. Landmarks the survivors said were near the execution sites--such as dams and railroad tracks--matched the locations the intelligence source had given 
me.<BR>
<BR>
After the problems at the first checkpoint, the three-hour drive to the sites went 
smoothly. I was forced at one checkpoint to give a Bosnian Serb soldier a ride for 
30 miles, but made it to the first site near the village of Sahanici by early afternoon.<BR>
<BR>
I found a school whose layout and surroundings exactly matched a school survivors 
said was used to hold prisoners before they were taken in groups of 10 to 15 to the 
execution site. A half-mile away, I found two large areas of fresh digging on either 
side of railroad tracks--exactly where my intelligence source and the survivors had said 
they would be.<BR>
<BR>
More than 100 civilians' jackets with no bullet holes in them were hidden in the woods 
100 feet away. There were no indications of a battle being fought. An ID from Srebrenica, 
an ID and photos with Muslim names on them and three canes were found in the pile of jackets. One of the areas of fresh digging reeked of rotting flesh.<BR>
<BR>
U.S. intelligence officials said the graves I had visited in Nova Kasabs could have 
held approximately 600 bodies. These appeared slightly larger and held probably 800 
bodies.<BR>
<BR>
I took photos, hid the IDs in the car and headed for a second execution site next 
to a nearby earthen dam, according to two other survivors I interviewed. I fruitlessly 
searched an area east of the dam for 30 minutes, found nothing, and then saw an old 
man walking in the distance with a dog.<BR>
<BR>
I decided to check one last area--a second gravel plateau--which fit the survivors' 
description of where the massacre took place. I pulled up onto the plateau and saw 
two human femurs lying on the gravel and other small objects in the distance.<BR>
<BR>
As I stepped out of the car to take a photo of them, I heard the old man--who I thought 
had simply walked by the dam--shout. He was on top of the dam pointing a rifle at 
me. I was finished.<BR>
<BR>
The old man, who I then realized was guarding the dam, arrested me and called the 
local police. Five days of interrogation at a local police station followed, with 
the Bosnian Serbs convinced I was a spy sent by the Muslim-led Bosnian government 
or NATO to take pictures of or blow up the earthen dam.<BR>
<BR>
The detailed U.N. military maps they found on me had marks indicating where the graves 
were. I knew carrying the maps would be dangerous but also knew being able to quickly 
find the graves was crucial.<BR>
<BR>
I carried all of my press accreditation cards--including numerous Bosnian and Croatian 
government ones that angered the Serbs--but they ended up being crucial to countering 
the espionage suspicions. Most importantly, they bought me time.<BR>
<BR>
The maps quickly became my biggest problem. The Serbs were convinced only a spy could 
obtain and read military maps and penetrate so deeply into their territory. Even 
after I admitted I was looking for mass graves and the Serbs told me they knew of 
my past stories, they insisted I was also on the CIA payroll.<BR>
<BR>
It wasn't until after they had developed my film, found the Muslim IDs and conducted 
five days of interrogation--which included one night of not allowing me to sleep--that 
the Serbs publicly admitted they were holding me. In the end, the photos of mass 
graves--not of military installations as the Serbs suspected--may have saved my life.<BR>
<BR>
I made many, many mistakes, but by far the biggest was going on the trip alone. I 
had never traveled on my own in Bosnia and deeply regret a decision that I did not 
fully think through.<BR>
<BR>
I did not take a translator because it would be unfair to place anyone in so much 
danger, and I could get by with my Serbian. I also turned down an opportunity to 
bring a reporter from the <CITE>New York Times </CITE>
with me for competitive reasons.<BR>
<BR>
In retrospect, I should have waited and found a British or French reporter to accompany 
me. But Sarajevo was empty at the time, and I was eager to make the trip on Sunday, 
Oct. 29--the day before peace talks began in Dayton, Ohio.<BR>
<BR>
I reached the graves I wanted to, and the Serbs again followed their long-running 
pattern of harassing, but not harming, Western civilians, as I hoped. In the end, 
it was a calculated risk worth taking.<CITE><BR>

<H2>Murdering with Impunity in Russia: </H2>
<H3>Authorities Fail to Prosecute the Murders of Seven Journalists</H3>
by David Satter<BR>
<BR>
In post-Communist Russia, journalists are no longer threatened with long labor camp sentences for writing freely. 
But they risk their lives if they report on organized crime or corruption in the 
armed forces or if the financial interests of their media organization bring them 
into conflict with a corrupt group. <BR>
<BR>
In the last two years, at least seven Russian journalists were deliberately murdered 
and six of these murders had the hallmarks of contract killings, a category of murder 
in which Russia now leads the entire world. <BR>
<BR>
More unsettling than the killings themselves, however, has been the attitude of the 
Russian authorities. Despite the fact that a number of the murdered journalists have 
been national celebrities, there has been little effort to bring the perpetrators 
to justice. Instead, after a journalist is murdered, an investigation begins, sometimes 
with considerable fanfare, and the effort then fades amid signs that investigators 
are being hampered by interference at a high official level. <BR>
<BR>
Presently, nearly all legitimate private business in Russia is controlled by or forced 
to pay extortion money to organized crime. There are an estimated 5,000 criminal 
gangs, 300 mob bosses and 150 illegal organizations with international ties in the 
country.<BR>
<BR>
The prevalence of corruption and organized crime, in fact, means that investigative 
journalism is very necessary to Russia but little is carried out. The reason is simple, 
said Yevgenia Albats, a reporter for <CITE>Izvestia </CITE>
and the author of the book <CITE>A State Within a State: The KGB and Its Hold on Russia, Past, Present and Future. 
</CITE>
"If you do journalism that deals with certain sensitive issues, you can easily get 
killed."<BR>
<BR>
According to Shod Muladjanov, editor of <CITE>Moskovskaya Pravda, </CITE>
"We [journalists] are in a fight against the gangs. They have a hand on us wherever 
they are, in the Kremlin, in the government, in the television industry.... And no 
law enforcement body in the country protects our rights."<BR>
<BR>
On Oct. 17, 1994, Dmitry Kholodov, a 27-year-old investigative reporter for <CITE>Moskovski Komsomolets, </CITE>
Moscow's largest daily newspaper, entered the paper's offices with an attach&eacute; case 
left for him at the Kazan Station.<BR>
<BR>
"Vadim," he shouted, to Vadim Poegli, the newspaper's deputy editor, "I think I've 
got something." Moments later, in the room where Kholodov had gone to study the contents 
of the briefcase, the attach&eacute; case exploded, leaving Kholodov mortally injured, the lower part of his body shattered by the force of the blast.<BR>
<BR>
The death of Kholodov stunned Russian journalists, who were horrified not only by 
the crime itself but by the brazen way it was carried out--with a bomb obviously intended 
to go off in a crowded newspaper office. It was sheer chance that prevented other 
people from being killed. <BR>
<BR>
In the aftermath of the crime, Russian President Boris Yeltsin said that he would 
personally supervise the investigation. More than 5,000 people attended Kholodov's 
funeral, where speakers, including Russia's most prominent democratic leaders, denounced 
the crime as an attack on free speech. But in the months since Kholodov was killed, 
little progress has been made in arresting those responsible for his death. <BR>
<BR>
Pavel Gusev, the editor of <CITE>Moskovski Komsomolets, </CITE>
told CPJ in November that after 13 months, the investigation of the Kholodov murder 
was "running in place." He said he was convinced that the investigators already had 
identified the thread capable of leading them to the people who ordered the journalist's killing, but further progress was being blocked by high-ranking officials.<BR>
<BR>
Virtually all of the paper's staff members have been interviewed by the prosecutor, 
and they are prevented from discussing the case while the investigation is proceeding. 
That is an obligation that they say they will ignore once they are completely convinced the investigation is going nowhere.<BR>
<BR>
In the meantime, Gusev said, the newspaper has carried out its own investigation, 
and if the official inquiry does not make progress soon, the paper is prepared to 
print what it knows. Gusev told CPJ that he and at least 14 other people are familiar 
with the results of the paper's investigation and, in the event of his untimely death, 
a plan is in place for the paper's findings to be published immediately. <BR>
<BR>
No one, however, underestimates the difficulty of bringing the perpetrator or perpetrators 
to justice. "The killing was prepared for a long time," said Natalya Yefimova, the 
paper's deputy editor, "and the killer was someone Dima trusted. Several months before the explosion, Dima received a tip and avoided danger by hiding himself for 
several days. This happened after he wrote an article about corruption in the Western 
Group of Forces [stationed in East Germany]."<BR>
<BR>
Since November 1995, there have been fewer and fewer contacts between the prosecutor 
and the staff of <CITE>Moskovski Komsomolets, </CITE>
and when investigators have come to the newspaper, it has been mostly to go over 
old ground.<BR>
<BR>
Kholodov's colleagues say that there is growing sentiment at the paper in favor of 
going public. Nonetheless, there are dangers in publishing the results of the paper's 
investigation. "It could be dangerous to reveal our cards," said Yefimova. "The people who are guilty have alibis, and the people in the special services who helped them 
carry out the murder know how to disappear."<BR>
<BR>
On June 17, 1995, Natalya Alyakina, a free-lance correspondent for RUFA, a German radio news service, 
and <CITE>Focus, </CITE>
a weekly magazine, was shot dead by a Russian soldier minutes after being waved past 
a Russian checkpoint outside the city of Budyonnovsk in southern Russia at the height 
of a hostage crisis. <BR>
<BR>
As in the Kholodov murder, the investigation in this case has been slow, inconclusive 
and seemingly intended to shield the perpetrator rather than to solve the crime. 
<BR>
<BR>
According to Alyakina's husband, Gisbert Mrozek, who also worked for RUFA and <CITE>Focus </CITE>
and was riding in the car with his wife when she was killed, he and Alyakina had left 
Moscow on June 16 for Mineralnaya Voda to cover the hostage crisis. They were on 
their way to Budyonnovsk the next day in a car driven by Vladimir Martirosian when 
they were stopped at a Russian checkpoint about 250 meters outside the city.<BR>
<BR>
Mrozek had heard reports of Russian soldiers' hostility toward the press but he and 
Alyakina passed through the checkpoint without incident. The soldiers on duty looked 
at their press documents and waved them on with the words "Happy journey."<BR>
<BR>
Minutes later, however, as they were driving away in the direction of Budyonnovsk, 
two shots rang out, and Alyakina, bleeding heavily from a neck wound, slumped over 
and said to her husband, "They killed me. I'm dying. Don't leave my son, Artyem. 
I love you." She lost consciousness about a minute later.<BR>
<BR>
Mrozek helped Alyakina out of the car and began shouting, "Why did you kill my wife?" 
Almost immediately, an armored car arrived from the checkpoint, and Alyakina was 
put in the vehicle along with Martirosian, who was also hit.<BR>
<BR>
Mrozek was then driven by the police into Budyonnovsk. He was taken to a hospital 
where he was told that Martirosian was seriously injured and his wife was dead. <BR>
<BR>
In the months since Alyakina was killed, Mrozek has watched with dismay as the military 
prosecutor has investigated the case in a manner that demonstrates both indifference 
and incompetence. <BR>
<BR>
Even though Alyakina was struck through the rear window of her car, the glass from 
the window was thrown away. The machine gun that fired the fatal shot was not fixed 
in place, and no photographs were taken of the scene. <BR>
<BR>
In fact, there was little attempt even to begin an investigation until Sept. 7, when, 
under pressure from the German government (Alyakina held dual Russian-German citizenship), 
the authorities assigned a special prosecutor, Lt. Col. Andrei Kondratkov, to the case.<BR>
<BR>
At the request of Mrozek and Alyakina's relatives, a re-enactment of the shooting 
took place in early October. The soldier who fired the fatal shot, Sergei Fedotov, 
has claimed that the shooting was inadvertent and that he accidentally activated 
a machine gun with his foot while climbing into an armored personnel carrier.<BR>
<BR>
At the re-enactment, Fedotov showed how he climbed down into the armored vehicle and 
touched the trigger of the machine gun with his foot. Mrozek requested that Fedotov 
actually fire the weapon, which was controlled by a double lever specifically to 
prevent an accidental firing.<STRONG> </STRONG>
But because the scene of the re-enactment was near Budyonnovsk, for safety reasons 
the demonstration was transferred to a nearby training field.<BR>
<BR>
At the field, however, Fedotov was no longer present. Instead, a Russian officer took 
his place and succeeded in firing two shots from the machine gun with his foot. The 
demonstration, however, left open a critical question. The officer knew in advance 
that he was to perform the complicated maneuver, and his performance did nothing to 
convince Mrozek that the same thing could have been done by a young recruit <CITE>by accident. </CITE>
<BR>
<BR>
Mrozek told CPJ that he will ask for a new re-enactment of the shooting, in which 
Fedotov himself demonstrates how he was able to fire the machine gun. The widower 
said that he will also ask for a psychologist's testimony on the plausibility of 
the soldier's story.<BR>
<BR>
 "I don't think that someone wanted to kill Natalya," said Mrozek. "I think it was 
intended as a joke, to force journalists to hit the ground. There were other cases 
of shooting at cars by internal troops. Some of the passengers were killed and that 
was all.<BR>
<BR>
 "This was the result of hatred of journalists. The soldiers fired in the direction 
of the car not caring whether they killed someone or not."<BR>
<BR>
Vladislav Listyev, the executive director of Russia's newly formed public television station ORT, and, 
in the opinion of many, the most popular television journalist in the country, was 
murdered in the hallway of his apartment building in the center of Moscow on March 
1, 1995.<BR>
<BR>
The murder apparently was connected to his role in the reorganization of the state-owned 
Ostankino television company as ORT, a joint stock venture. <BR>
<BR>
In this case, too, there has been little progress in the investigation, and there 
are widespread fears that the authorities are not really interested in finding the 
killers. <BR>
<BR>
At the end of 1994, Ostankino was reconstituted as ORT by a decree from Yeltsin that 
granted 51 percent of the shares in the new independent company to the state and 
49 percent to Russian banks. Listyev was named the executive director of the station, 
and the transition was set to take place on April 1, 1995. The first few months of 1995 
provided an opportunity for a re-examination of many aspects of the station's operation, 
and one of Listyev's first acts after becoming director was to order the suspension of all advertising on the station beginning April 1.<BR>
<BR>
In fact, a re-evaluation of the station's advertising policies was long overdue. The 
advertising was being brokered through 12 mafia-controlled intermediary firms, which 
sold it at vastly inflated prices. The channel, capable of reaching 100 million people, was extremely attractive for advertisers, and the value of advertising time on 
Ostankino grew from virtually nothing in 1992 to $30 million a month today. Some 
time slots on the station were booked until the year 2000. Listyev's decision raised 
the prospect of massive losses for the nation's advertising syndicates and possible bankruptcy 
for some agencies.<BR>
<BR>
Listyev was murdered one month before his suspension order was to take effect, and 
it is widely believed that an Ostankino advertising syndicate ordered his death. 
But even with such obvious leads to follow, official investigators have made no progress 
in the case. <BR>
<BR>
Most people believe Listyev's killers will never be found, said Boris I. Uvarov, a 
senior special investigator in the Internal Affairs Ministry. Uvarov headed the group 
that investigated the case from March until June, when he was fired for failing to 
follow an order from his superiors. Higher-ups in the prosecutor's office asked Uvarov 
to sanction the arrest of an employee of the Federal Security Service (FSB) in connection 
with the Listyev killing. He refused because the employee was not, in fact, connected to the case, and it became obvious to him that the prosecutor's office wanted 
to use the arrest to put pressure on the FSB, which, at the time, was investigating 
a case involving some relatives of Alexei Ilyushenko, the general prosecutor.<BR>
<BR>
The staff of the investigative group in the Listyev case has now been changed three 
times, hampering the effectiveness of the probe.<BR>
<BR>
There have also been repeated rumors about arrests, many of them printed in newspaper 
articles quoting "competent sources." Many investigators, however, believe the rumors 
originate in the prosecutor's office and are intended to distract attention from 
the lack of progress in the case. They believe that the authorities are not really interested 
in finding the killers and do everything possible to muddle the investigation.<BR>
<BR>
In addition to the well-known cases, there have been a number of murders of less well-known journalists, 
sometimes outside of Moscow, and these, too, show every sign of not having been seriously 
investigated.<BR>
<BR>
On Feb. 13, 1995, Viatcheslav Rudnev, a free-lance reporter who had written stories 
for the local press in Kaluga about corruption and the criminal underworld, was found 
with a fractured skull in the entryway to the apartment building where he had lived 
for years. He died four days later. <BR>
<BR>
Although it had been established that Rudnev had not been drinking that evening, after 
a brief investigation the local police ruled that his death was an accident and that 
Rudnev fell on the stairway and hit his head.<BR>
<BR>
This version of events leaves several unanswered questions. Before his death, Rudnev 
told friends that his life had been threatened, but no attempt was made to learn 
the source of these threats either at the time he reported them or after he died.<BR>
<BR>
Journalists in Kaluga believe that Rudnev was struck on the head and then left at 
the bottom of the stairwell to make it look as if he had fallen.<BR>
<BR>
On Feb. 1, 1994, Sergei Dubov, the publisher of the advertising newspaper <CITE>Vsyo Dlya Vas, </CITE>
was shot dead in front of his apartment building. Since his murder, which was preceded 
by weeks of death threats, no one has been arrested or charged. <BR>
<BR>
Dubov, who was the first publisher of the complete works of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, 
had also created a publishing house in association with the Russian weekly magazine 
<CITE>New Times. </CITE>
The affiliation allowed him to use the magazine's name, building, correspondents 
and infrastructure for a variety of commercial and publishing ventures.<BR>
<BR>
In the months before his death, he had obvious financial difficulties and was unable 
to pay either rent or salaries. In December 1993, Dubov began to tell colleagues 
that he thought he might be killed, and before his death the vice presidents of his 
publishing house cashed in their shares in the company.<BR>
<BR>
Despite possible leads to the identity of the killer in Dubov's tangled financial 
affairs, there has been no progress in solving the case.<BR>
<BR>
Alexander Pumpiansky, the editor of <CITE>New Times </CITE>
and a friend of Dubov's, said that Dubov's deputy was briefly arrested and accused 
of financial manipulations but then freed.<BR>

On June 12, 1994, Yuri Soltis, a crime reporter for the Interfax News Agency, was 
found beaten to death at a train station in the Stroitel district on the outskirts 
of Moscow. He was so badly beaten that it took the police three days to identify 
him. Soltis' colleagues told CPJ that his murder was linked to his investigations of Moscow's 
criminal underworld but no suspects have ever been identified.<BR>
<BR>
On Dec. 27, 1995, Vadim Alferyev, a crime reporter with <CITE>Segodnyashnyaya Gazeta </CITE>
in the Siberian industrial city of Krasnoyarsk, was beaten to death in the entrance 
to his apartment building. Alferyev was writing about economic crimes in the region 
and had received repeated threats. At this writing, no suspects have been arrested, 
and there is no reported progress in the investigation.<BR>
<BR>
The failure of Russian authorities to vigorously investigate the murder of journalists is now part of the reality of 
the post-Communist epoch. Just as in the past, when investigators were forced to 
desist once a crime probe led to a high-ranking party official, they now find themselves 
restrained when they uncover the trail of high-ranking military figures or leaders of 
organized crime. <BR>
<BR>
In fact, however, the murderers of journalists can be found and prosecuted. Gangsters 
in Russia and the rest of the former Soviet Union are so convinced of their invulnerability 
that they do little to disguise their identities. The authorities in Lithuania this year arrested and convicted the killers of Vitas Lingis, a reporter for the 
newspaper <CITE>Respublika </CITE>
who had written about the activities of the Lithuanian mob. One of his murderers 
has been sentenced to death. <BR>
<BR>
But bringing those who kill journalists to justice requires a commitment to the rule 
of law. So far, there is no such commitment in Russia. And ultimately, it is only 
with the protection of the law that a free press can hope to survive.<BR>
