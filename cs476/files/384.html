</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

For centuries, people from around the world have been coming to the United States. They come to work, get an education, escape oppression, start a new life, do business, visit friends, or sightsee. Over the years, the United States has seen tremendous diversity in the countries immigrants come from and their reasons for coming here. In response to the incredible demand for permission to enter this country, the federal government has established a complex set of laws that determines who may enter this country and for what reasons. This chapter discusses legal immigration and travel to the United States.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>United States Citizenship </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
United States citizens have a right to travel to and live in the United States and enjoy the fullest protection of United States laws. People who are not citizens of the United States usually must have a visa to enter and may not enjoy the protection of all United States laws. 
<P>
A person can become a United States citizen either through birth or through a process known as naturalization. A person can be a United States citizen from birth either by being born here, or by being born in a foreign country but having a parent who is a citizen of the United States. Anyone born in the United States has automatic citizenship, regardless of the parents' citizenship, and even if both parents are living in this country illegally at the time of the child's birth. The only exception is that children born to foreign diplomats in the United States do not get automatic citizenship. Anyone not born a citizen must be naturalized to become a citizen. Occasionally, a group of people is naturalized by treaty or by act of Congress. Usually, a person goes through the process individually.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="30"><H2><STRONG>Aliens, Immigrants, Nonimmigrants, and Residents </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
An alien is a citizen of any country other than the United States. A person who comes here to stay permanently is called an immigrant. Someone who intends to return to his or her country of origin is called a nonimmigrant, even if he or she intends to stay for a substantial period of time. For example, a student might stay in the United States many years to complete an education and still be considered a nonimmigrant. The distinction between immigrant and nonimmigrant is crucial. Permission to enter as a nonimmigrant often is easier to get than permission to enter as an immigrant, so some people are tempted to claim they intend to return to their home country in order to enter this country. The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) is aware of this temptation and often will deny a nonimmigrant visa application to anyone suspected of wanting to remain permanently. Also, being granted a nonimmigrant visa sometimes can make it more difficult to get an immigrant visa later. A permanent resident is an alien who has been given permission to live permanently in the United States. 
<P>
In a dispute with the INS over an applicant's true intent, the applicant always bears the burden of proving intent to remain here temporarily. For some people, this burden is nearly impossible to overcome. For example, the spouse of a permanent resident normally must wait over two years for available immigrant visas. If he or she claims to want to visit only temporarily, he or she must overcome the presumption that a married person would want to remain permanently with his or her spouse.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="40"><H2><STRONG>The Visa System </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A visa is a stamp in a person's passport that gives him or her conditional approval to enter the United States. Most matters involving visas are handled by the INS. Most aliens apply for visas from a consulate or embassy of the United States in the alien's home country. 
<P>
Citizens of some countries, primarily European countries and Japan, may enter the United States for up to 90 days without a visa. To be eligible, citizens of these countries must show the INS that they have a return ticket home and that they intend to engage in a type of business or tourist activity that would be allowed under a "B Visa," described below. Canadian citizens generally do not need visas to enter temporarily. In some instances, they must obtain INS approval in advance if they are coming here to work. 
<P>
Congress establishes a complex set of quotas that limits the number of visas that can be granted for most types of visas. Whether an applicant receives a visa depends on the type of visa requested, the applicant's reason for traveling to the United States, and the applicant's country of origin. Probably the most important element to obtaining a visa successfully is knowing for which visa category to apply. For certain categories of visas and certain countries of origin, an applicant can wait many years before he or she even will be considered for a visa. Sometimes the wait would be much shorter if the applicant applied for a different type of visa. Unfortunately, once an applicant applies for one type of visa, it can be difficult to change the application to another class of visa. For this reason, it is wise to consult an immigration attorney before applying for any kind of visa.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Nonimmigrant Visas </STRONG></H3></A>
There are different kinds of nonimmigrant visas, identified by the letters A-R, available for persons who do not intend to remain in the United States permanently. All nonimmigrant visas are based on what the applicant intends to do in this country. Following is a list of the visa categories.

engage in litigation, or negotiate contracts. B-2 visas, the most common
nonimmigrant visas, allow aliens to enter the country temporarily to engage
in tourism, visit with friends or relatives, or to receive medical treatment.

<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>Immigrant Visas </STRONG></H3></A>
An applicant who intends to stay in this country permanently generally is admitted either on the basis of employment or family connections. The main exception is for political asylum seekers.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="70"><H4><STRONG>Employment-Based Immigration </STRONG></H4></A>
An alien can receive permission to immigrate to this country on the basis of his or her employment. There are five categories of employment, known as preferences, through which aliens can be permitted to immigrate.
<P>
<STRONG>First Preference</STRONG>: Individuals of extraordinary ability, outstanding professors or researchers, and multinational executives.
<P>
<STRONG>Second Preference</STRONG>: Professionals with advanced degrees and aliens with exceptional abilities in science, art, or business. (Note: "Exceptional ability" is a different standard than "extraordinary ability" required for a first preference.)
<P>
<STRONG>Third Preference</STRONG>: Skilled workers, professionals, and other workers for which there is a shortage of workers in the United States.
<P>
<STRONG>Fourth Preference</STRONG>: Certain special workers, such as religious workers.
<P>
<STRONG>Fifth Preference</STRONG>: Investors creating employment for workers in the United States; the investment must be substantial (i.e., between $500,000 and $1,000,000).
<P>
<DD><A NAME="80"><H4><STRONG>Family-Based Immigration </STRONG></H4></A>
An alien can get a visa as an immediate relative of a United States citizen if he or she is a child, spouse, or parent of the citizen. In addition, there are four family-based immigrant visa categories:
<P> 
<STRONG>First Preference</STRONG>: Unmarried children of United States citizens.
<P>
<STRONG>Second Preference</STRONG>: Spouses and unmarried children of lawful permanent residents.
<P>
<STRONG>Third Preference</STRONG>: Married children of United States citizens.
<P>
<STRONG>Fourth Preference</STRONG>: Siblings of adult United States citizens.
<P>
Each preference is allotted a total number of visas. Generally speaking, the higher the applicant's preference, the shorter the wait to get a visa.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="90"><H4><STRONG>Special Classes of Immigrants </STRONG></H4></A>
Some groups of immigrants receive special treatment and fall outside the preference system described above. 
<P>
Diversity immigrants are immigrants from countries deemed under-represented in the pool of applicants for visas throughout the years. Under a new program implemented by the INS in 1995, a certain number of visas will be granted to applicants from low-admission countries and who have a high school education or two years of training or experience in a particular occupation. 
<P>
Refugees and asylees also receive special treatment. A person is a refugee if he or she is outside the United States, is fleeing or has fled his or her country, and has a well-founded fear that if returned to the home country, he or she will be persecuted because of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. An asylee is an alien already in the United States who, like a refugee, has a well-founded fear of persecution if returned to his or her home country. The president and Congress decide each year the total number of refugees and asylees to accept into the country. Occasionally, Congress grants immigrant visas allotted for individuals from specific countries according to political factors. Recent programs have included China, Hong Kong, and Tibet.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="100"><H2><STRONG>Entry and Exclusion </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A visa only gives conditional approval to enter the country. Once an alien arrives in the United States with a visa, he or she must apply for entry from INS officials at the point of entry. For most aliens, this is a mere formality, but the INS can exclude persons with valid visas for a variety of reasons, including communicable diseases, physical or mental disorders that pose a threat to others, drug addiction, or criminal history. Involvement in espionage or terrorist activity against the United States government or its people is grounds for exclusion. The Secretary of State also has broad discretion to bar entry of anyone whose presence would have an adverse effect on the foreign policy of the United States. Sometimes waivers are available for aliens who otherwise would be denied entry for certain reasons. For example, the child of a United States citizen may be granted a waiver to enter to receive treatment for drug addiction.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="110"><H2><STRONG>Getting a Green Card and Becoming a Naturalized Citizen </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Becoming a permanent resident is the first step that an alien must take to become a naturalized American citizen. People with permission to live in the United States permanently are issued "green cards" that allow them to work with few restrictions. A permanent resident can apply to become a naturalized citizen after five years, or three years if married to a United States citizen. 
<P>
The INS is diligent in investigating marriages between United States citizens and aliens to ensure that aliens do not become permanent residents through sham marriages. Immigration law specifies that an alien seeking permanent residence based on a marriage to a United States citizen of less than two years first is granted conditional permanent resident status. After two years, the husband and wife must apply to the INS to remove this conditional status.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="120"><H2><STRONG>Deportation </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Deportation is the expulsion of an alien who entered the United States illegally, or entered legally but has done something to become deportable. With few exceptions, any violation of the conditions of a visa, no matter how minor, is grounds for deportation to a person's country of origin. Conviction for any crime but the most minor is also grounds for deportation. Deportation can delay an alien whose long-term goal is to live permanently in this country. After being deported, aliens are forbidden to re-enter the country for five years. Aliens deported for aggravated felonies, such as drug smuggling, are barred from re-entry for 20 years or may be barred permanently. The delay in returning to the United States may be even greater for aliens from countries with long waiting lists. Returning home under a deportation order may result in the embassy's refusal to entrust the individual with another temporary visa. 
<P>
There are a number of remedies to deportation, especially if the deportable person has lived in the United States for a long time, building a life that demonstrates good moral character. Even if the deportable individual has not been here long, there may be certain waivers or defenses to deportation. Among the most common is asking the court for "voluntary departure," which allows the individual to depart the United States on his or her own. In any case, anyone facing deportation should seek the advice of counsel well in advance of a deportation hearing.
