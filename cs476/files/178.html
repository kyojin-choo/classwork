This is a digital elevation model that was geometrically 
coded directly onto an X-band seasonal change image of the 
Oetztal supersite in Austria.  The image is centered at 
46.82 degrees north latitude and 10.79 degrees east 
longitude.  This image is located in the Central Alps at the 
border between Switzerland, Italy and Austria, 50 kilometers 
(31 miles) southwest of Innsbruck.  It was acquired by the 
Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-band Synthetic Aperture aboard 
the space shuttle Endeavour on April 14, 1994 and on October 
5, 1994.  It was produced by combining data from these two 
different data sets. Data obtained in April is green; data 
obtained in October appears in red and blue, and was used as 
an enhancement based on the ratio of the two data sets.  
Areas with a decrease in backscatter from April to October 
appear in light blue (cyan), such as the large 
Gepatschferner glacier seen at the left of the image center, 
and most of the other glaciers in this view.  A light blue 
hue is also visible at the east border of the dark blue Lake 
Reschensee at the upper left side.  This shows a significant 
rise in the water level.  Magenta represents areas with an 
increase of backscatter from April 10 to October 5. Yellow 
indicates areas with high radar signal response during both 
passes, such as the mountain slopes facing the radar.  Low 
radar backscatter signals refer to smooth surface (lakes) or 
radar grazing areas to radar shadow areas, seen in the 
southeast slopes.  The area is approximately 29 kilometers 
by 21 kilometers (18 miles by 13.5 miles).  The summit of 
the main peaks reaches elevations of 3,500 to 3,768 meters 
(xx feet to xx feet) above sea level.  The test site's core 
area is the glacier region of Venter Valley, which is one of 
the most intensively studied areas for glacier research in 
the world.  Research in Venter Valley (below center) 
includes studies of glacier dynamics, glacier-climate 
regions, snowpack conditions and glacier hydrology.  About 
25 percent of the core test site is covered by glaciers.  
Corner reflectors are set up for calibration.  Five corner 
reflectors can be seen on the Gepatschferner and two can be 
seen on the Vernagtferner.
