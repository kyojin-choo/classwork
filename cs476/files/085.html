<h2 align=center><u>Product Description<br>
</u></h2>
<p>With AESOP you can maintain direct control of the video image while using both hands to cut, suture, and irrigate. With cost 
containment more important than ever, AESOP is as necessary in today's OR as the scope itself. <br>
</p>

<p align=center><font size=2>AESOP extends your reach in the OR<br>
</font></p>
<p>Holding to your highest surgical standards just got a lot easier. The Automated Endoscopic System for Optimal Positioning 
(AESOP) gives you total, precise control of the video image during procedures, and frees your staff from the constraints of 
scope-holding. The first ever robotic laparoscope positioner, AESOP helps make procedures safer for your patient, more 
efficient for your hospital, and less tiring for you and your staff. In fact, AESOP has benefits that make it an absolute necessity in 
today's standard laparoscopic setup.<br>
</p>
<h3>Get the Benefits of Superior Scope Positioning<br>
</h3>
<p>Now you can position the scope exactly where, how and when you choose, as well as maintain a steady image, without 
constantly relaying commands to a scopeholding assistant. Adjustments are made with easy-to-use Foot or Hand Controls or 
with the Manual Mode button on the robotic arm itself. The ReView&#174; feature, a simple button-touch program remembers 
scope positioning for important operative sites.<br>
