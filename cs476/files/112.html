<H3>Healing comes in its own time</H3>

<H3>by Rick Gossett</H3>

<P>
In earlier cultures, the Shaman was usually present at the death
of an individual to help their soul to move on to Heaven, the
Valhallah, the Light, or whatever the &#145;other side&#146; was
perceived to be. It was a time of healing for the family and community,
and it is a process now referred to as psychopomp.
<P>
Unfortunately, in our modern culture, people die and there is
no such Spirit work done. The family is often spread out over
the country, and they may not even gather for the funeral. Yet,
the work is there. Souls that are either confused, obstinate or
have unfinished business do not move on to the Spirit world. 
<P>
The following two examples demonstrate the significance of this
kind of work. A man from my mentor group in Seattle was called
to go to Malaysia where a huge clothing store had collapsed, killing
hundreds of people. However, he returned from his trip looking
very puzzled. He had not been able to find very many souls. Our
group contributed this to the fact that Malaysia had a culture
which took care of this kind of work, but the news later reported
the loss of only six lives. The rest of the &#145;bodies&#146;
were store dummies! 
<P>
The second example involves my grandmother who died last month
at 95, a very angry and bitter woman. She was estranged from her
family, so I had only met her a few times. I had no grief or sense
of loss at her passing. Yet, I felt compelled to do something
at the time of her funeral, which was being held in another part
of the country.
<P>
I journeyed and asked my totems to take me to her spirit, knowing
that she was probably still around. When I found her, she was
so angry that I couldn&#146;t get close to her. Not knowing what
else to do, I began to sing to her.  She stopped her raging and
looked at me, seeing me for the first time. My mind said that
we were family, that we shared the same genes, but that it went
deeper than that. She was a good woman who had had a bad life,
and I cared for her. I saw her soul. That soul part, though attenuated
in her, looked back at me and responded. 
<P>
At this point in the journey my face was wet with tears. I held
out my hands to her and she came to me. As she came, a large,
heavy cloak dropped away from her. She was young again and smiling.
Still singing, I turned her towards the Light. Just before she
went into it, she turned and threw back several things. They fluttered
and were gone. She smiled again and said, &#147;I don&#146;t really
need those, and they are not mine anyway.&#148; Then she was gone.
They had been soul parts that she had stolen. They were now free
to return to those to whom they belonged.  As the Light expanded,
so did the joy in my heart. I returned from my journey, knowing
that healing comes in its own time&#151;as it did for my grandmother,
and for me.
