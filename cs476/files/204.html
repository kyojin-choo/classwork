<h2>Introduction</h2>

<P><B>SPORT</B> is a text-based offline software package which makes it possible to write ABB robot programs in the language Arla on an external personal computer and then download them to an S3 robot controller. It is fully compatible with Arla programmes created by Workspace and may be used as an alternative to using ABB software to download these text files to an S3 controller.</p> 

<P>The latest release of <B>SPORT</B> has the following capabilities:</P>
