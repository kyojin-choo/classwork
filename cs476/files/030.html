<P ALIGN=left>One of the Authority's oldest facilities is the Jack D. Lausch, Sr. Transfer Station, located  just  beyond the city limits of Lancaster at 1291 Harrisburg Pike.

<P ALIGN=left>Built in 1968, expanded in 1978 and 1984, and completely renovated in 1990, the transfer station serves as a central drop-off point for trash haulers who collect refuse within the 946 square miles which make up Lancaster County.

<P ALIGN=left>Every day, more than 200 commercial haulers and residents pass over the transfer station's  electronic scales which record, via computer, the amount of waste contained in each vehicle. Trash is deposited in one of four bays, where the waste is compacted into Authority transfer trailers. Each day, these transfer trailers haul approximately 800 tons of waste to either the resource recovery facility, the Frey Farm Landfill or a recycling center.

<P ALIGN=left>In addition to being centrally located within the county, the    transfer station also provides  Authority compliance officers the opportunity to inspect each load of waste to make sure the materials are acceptable and to dispatch that waste to the  appropriate disposal site. Combustible materials go to the resource recovery facility while noncombustible items are directed to the Frey Farm Landfill.

<P ALIGN=left>The Authority sends recyclables to various recycling markets, while the on-site Household Hazardous Waste Facility collects hazardous wastes generated in area homes.

<P ALIGN=left>The Authority also requires separate delivery of materials which may be better disposed through methods other than resource recovery or landfilling.  For example, all tires and white goods (household appliances) must be delivered separately from other refuse. Tires are sent to a recycling facility and white goods, after chlorofluoro- carbon gas removal, are taken to recycling centers.  

<P ALIGN=left>The transfer station includes a maintenance facility, where mechanics perform most repair  work and state inspections on Authority vehicles and equipment.  The maintenance facility also houses a tire changing room, welding shop, wash bay, paint bay and offices.

<P ALIGN=left>For the convenience of the employees who work at the transfer station, the complex includes a lunchroom and locker rooms.
