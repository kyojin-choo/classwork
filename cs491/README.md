# CMSC-491-Project
Our Intro to Data Science project that explores the relationship between crime and the amount of libraries in each Baltimore district. We used data from OpenBaltimore, an open source database with information regarding Baltimore city, and Jupyter notebook to create visualizations of our findings. This repo holds supplementary materials for our formal report that we submit as it shows the code we used to manipulate the data, which can be found in [CMSC491_project.ipynb](./CMSC491_project.ipynb).
